            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE</hi> time is already come, which our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, ſhould be, before the Fabrick of this world ſhould be diſſolved; take heed (ſaith he) you bee not deceived, for many ſhall come in my name, and ſhall ſay, I am Chriſt; and that time draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh, but go not after them. And when you ſhall heare of wars and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, be not affraid; for theſe things muſt firſt be, but the end is not yet; for Nation ſhall riſe againſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Kingdome againſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and there ſhall be great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaks in divers places, and famines, and deaths, and there ſhall be terrors and oppoſitions, and great ſignes ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:10247:6"/> be ſeen from heaven, and there ſhall be great tempeſts; but before all theſe things come to paſſe, they ſhall violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay hands upon you, they ſhall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, and deliver you up to their Synagogues, &amp; into priſons, and ſhal ſet you before Kings and Governors, for my Name ſake; your own parents, brethren, kindred and friends ſhall betray you, and they ſhall put ſome of you to death, and you ſhall bee hated of everybody. He that makes a doubt of the fulfilling of this Propheſie, let him caſt his eyes upon the actions of the former age, and behold the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, which is even acted in the ſight of all men, which dyes in purple both the body and eſtates of all men, and yet its Cataſtrophe doth not yet a peare to us! How many imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſts forged in hell! hath the old Serpent put upon us; he hath ſuffered (almoſt) no age to paſſe, wherein he hath not hammered out new Authors, and Princes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and hath prepared new ways
<pb facs="tcp:10247:6"/> for impious devotion; ſo that we are (even) reſerved to that time, than which none was ever more fierce for Religion, nor more barren in Piety. If any more ſincere, and more unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than the reſt, be given us from heaven, that may ſhew us the path to thoſe heavenly manſions, and that faith which is the only ladder to life eternall, and commands to bee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with works, &amp; bids thoſe other perſonating ſectaries of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to carry more devotion in their hearts than in their countenances, and to be fiercer in doing than ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhall ſcarce get from them without hiſsing, and a clowniſh jeere; I dare ſay that theſe very things doe happen even within the Orchyard of the Church. How many witneſſes of the Goſpels truth are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by our adverſaries to make themſelves paſtime, to be deſtroyed by the cruell ſword, to be conſumed by the devouring flames, and to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within a dark priſon. In our age
<pb facs="tcp:10247:7"/> have wee ſeene Nation to riſe up againſt Nation, and their great burden preſsing the earth more than ever wee reade of in our bookes; we find, by daily experience, that fathers grow mad and cruell, againſt their own ſonnes; mothers againſt their daughters, and children againſt their parents, and that either for Chriſts, or Mammons ſake. Though we ſee not innumerable Cities over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by earthquaks, yet we know it to bee true in other parts of the World. We ſee armies of fires in the Firmament, repreſenting unto us and beſmeared with the humane blood, which is after to be ſhed; net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the breaking in of ſeas, and floods, any new thing; and more I need not ſay: for as <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, out of whom wee have taken ſomething of that we have formerly declared, doth write, when the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling waves hang over us, and doe threaten death, which they bring with them, wee call to mind, no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:10247:7"/> pleaſures, yea we caſt over boord thoſe very things for which we have made a long voyage; and all things, compared with our life, are ſet at nought. So we alſo, when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the waves of Gods wrath to ſwell high, we laye aſide the burthen of our wordly poſſeſsions, we remove our vaine deſires, and caſt from us the weight of all our worldly cares; being earneſtly and only ſollicitous for our hoped for eternal life. So ſhall it bee that thus lightned, the ſhip of our devotion may floate, which laden muſt ſink; for the cares which depreſſe us in this life, do draw our ſoules in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the deep, which is borne ſo much the higher, amidſt the billows of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as wee are carefull to rid it from the thoughts of this world; but there is another thing which wee ſhould duly conſider; in theſe our tempeſtuous times when a ſtorme doth firſt ariſe, the waves are then but ſmall, but preſently after they ſwell to bigger volumes, at length they
<pb facs="tcp:10247:8"/> mount ſo high, that by their lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they overturne all thoſe that ſaile upon them. Now alſo haſtens that extreame tempeſt of ſoules, that ſhall overwhelme the whole World, which ſets forth unto us its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by wars &amp; ſlaughters, as it were by ſome of his waves: And the neerer we do daily come to the end, ſo much the greater are the volumes of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which we behold; but at the laſt, when all the Elements are in a hurly burly, the Iudge will come amongſt us and bring an end of all things with him; and certainely it is but a moment till he ſhall ſhake, not only the earth, but the heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We ought (vigilantly) to looke for this tempeſt, and to be afraid of the waves that daily ſwell againſt us, and to foreſee what muſt follow upon theſe troubles, which buffet the World. God himſelfe warnes us ſo, ſaying, take heed leaſt at any time your hearts be over charged with gluttony and drunkenneſſe, for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:10247:8"/> is a ſmooth devill, a ſweet poyſon, a delightfull ſin; he that is poſſeſſed with it, hath not himſelf; and he that acts it, commits not a ſin, but is wholly ſin it ſelfe; and as the ſoule which is free from wine, is moſt wiſe and of the moſt excellent temper; ſo moyſtned with the vapours of wine, it is as it were enveloped in a cloud, it doth confound nature, makes us loſe grace, deſtroys our glory, and makes us incurre eternall damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He warnes us that we be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the cares of this life. For we cannot ſerve two, God and Mammon; for the love of riches doth farre more torture than refreſh our ſoules: to get them is toyleſome, we keepe them with feare, and loſe them with much ſorrow. He warnes us that we watch at all times, and pray that wee may bee worthy to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the evils to come, and to ſtand before the ſonne of man. Let us watch, O let us watch! for that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day of our Lords comming is kept
<pb facs="tcp:10247:9"/> ſecret, that we might every day ſtand in awe. The Lord will come in an houre when wee thinke not of him, when wee ſhall ſay peace, and all things are ſafe. Whether we eate, or drinke, or whatſoever we do elſe, let that dreadfull voice alwayes ſound in our eares. Ariſe ye dead, and come unto judgement. Let us watch, my companions, let us watch; hee ſhall be bleſſed, whoſoever he be, that doth nothing without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this Iudgement: let us pray, O my companions, let vs pray, let us pray without ceaſing, and let us cry with a ſtrong voyce to the Lord; and though wee ceaſe with our tongue, yet let us cry with good workes, and that without ceaſing; for prayer is rather of the heart, than of the lippes; rather of our workes, than of our words: the words of him that prays, are not ſo much obſerved by God, as the heart of the ſuppliant. By how much more we are oppreſſed with the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:10247:9"/> of carnall things; ſo much the more fervently we ought to bend our ſelves unto prayer. Let us pray continually, becauſe wee are alwayes tempted, and becauſe our ſins doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without intermiſsion to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent us, the world to deceive us, hell to devour us, and the devill to inſnare us. Let us ſurround God, making as it were a power against him by our prayers, that we may bind and overcome our ſinnes, the world, hell and the devill, and may without blame wait for the fixed houre, and the day of the univerſall doome. That houre ſhall not be unprofitable to us, which to others hath proved moſt fruitfull; for prayer quenched the fiery fornace for the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſtopped the Lions mouthes that they could not hurt <hi>Daniel;</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſeditious Iſraelites, for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> opened Paradiſe, locked up hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, made the barren wombe fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; looſed <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> bands; nay, he hath enlarged the confidence
<pb facs="tcp:10247:10"/> of prayer, which carryed <hi>Cornelius</hi> to heaven, and did juſtifie the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane.</hi> That I might ſtirre up and encreaſe this deſire of prayer of Groanes, and of Sighes in my ſelfe, not long ſince I framed this incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when <hi>Hanibal</hi> (as it were) was even at our gates, and raſh death commanded mee to ceaſe from my other labours: and I doe willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impart it to the youth that love learning and religion, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that pleaſe, to whom I wholly enthrall my ſelfe. I have willingly and wittingly paſſed over thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and brawles which many make againſt things of this nature; for I endeavoured not ſo much to ſharpen and embeliſh the wit, as to amend and better the ſoul; nor could I with a ſoaring wing of wit, compaſſe heaven and earth. If any deſire a ſmooth ſtyle, let him know that I made choyce rather to ſpeak in other mens words, and to recollect the ſentences of the Ancient, than to ſpeake in
<pb facs="tcp:10247:10"/> mine owne phraſe; and let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, not the ſtyle, but the ſenſe of the matter wherin theſe things are writ; neither whether it bee according to the uſuall manner of phraſe, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter be true; for if the ſenſe hee true, What skils it, ſaith a learned German, in ſo abſtruſe a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, whether thou cloath it in a fine or a courſe vaile or garment, ſo it be not uncomely? Surely my minde is good throughout, and if my humane tongue, or pen; ſhall any where fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let mee not bee too ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, for there is no malice or obſtinacie in it, though there may be weakneſſe and obſcurity: if any ſhall maintaine that theſe things are neither beſeeming my age or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall willingly give him leave to abound in his owne ſenſe, and (if he pleaſe) to bee wiſe in his owne conceit, yet every man ought to hold piety deare, and to be ſtudious of it, of whatſoever qualitie or years they be of. I am young, ſayes one, and
<pb facs="tcp:10247:11"/> now I will take my pleaſure, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will I repent. This is as much as to ſay, I will wound my ſelfe with my ſword, and then I will goe to the Chirurgion. Alas knoweſt thou not that a wound is received in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, that can hardly bee cured in a long time?

If I behold thee, what is it that in the firſt, ſecond, third, and laſt place doth offer it ſelfe unto me? it is love I obſerve, it is love that I ſee, and feele; all the objects of my eyes are love; the fiſhes in the Sea are ſparkes; each pile of graſſe in the feild is a ſpark; the trees in the orchards are ſparks; the leaves upon thoſe trees are ſparks; the often riſing and ſetting Sun is a ſpark; and his beames enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the world are ſparks; the Moon's a ſpark, and her hornes are ſparks; the glittering Sarrs and all the hoſt of Heaven are ſparks of it. If all the members which thou haſt beſtowed upon my body, were tongues, if I had the underſtanding of an Angell, yet could I not comprehend or ſet forth the footſteps of thy love. O violent love, burning love, vehement love, love that cannot be kept within thee!

            <p>I was in honour O lord and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, even ſo great that I cannot
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10247:13"/> now ſet it forth; but when I was in honour I underſtood not what that honour was. In what an honoured place did I inhabit? in a place of delight. My life found neither trouble nor want; I was compaſſed with fragrant apples, I was propped up with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, crowned with glory and honour, and placed above the works made of clay. But I was the more excellent in regard of the badge of thy divine i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and my lot and company was the ſociety of Angels, and the whole Army of the Hoſt of Heaven; but I did change that glory into the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a calfe that eateth hay. How many virtues was I cloathed with? What did I want whom mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, truth inſtructed, juſtice did governe, and peace did cheriſh? But alas what ſhall I ſay O my God? thou beſtowedſt that property of reaſon upon me, whereby I might excell all living creatures, and didſt ſo ſublime it by a peculiar gift, that I wanted but little of attaining to thoſe thy moſt pure Miniſters; I knew this, but did not acknowledge it, nor did I weigh for what end thou gaveſtime this wiſdome. I call not that a good ſhip
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10247:14"/> that is painted with gaudy colours, nor which hath a guilded or ſilvered head, nor whoſe hull is inlayed with ivory, nor which is fraught with Kingly wares and treaſures: but that is ſtrong and firme, and hath thick ribs to ſhut out the waters, and tough to endure the aſſaulting Seas, that is pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to her rudder, can make good way and fetch all winds. I call that a good ſword, not that hath an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered belt, or whoſe ſcabard is ſet with pretious ſtones; but that that hath both a keene edge to cut, and a point that can pierce any armour. Men deſire a ſtraight rule and not a faire one; wee commend a thing ſo farre only as it is uſefull for that end for which it was made: So I, who did then know theſe things better than now, ought to have acknowledged that I received all good from thee; if I would have ordered my ſelfe according to the rule of thy heavenly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the obedience only which thou requiredſt, and which without thy command was due unto thee, had made mee bleſſed and perfect if I would, and had not obeyed the deteſtable ſuggeſtions of the old Serpent. From
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10247:14"/> my originall I was good, but that goodneſſe came only from thee; none of it was from mee, yet thou wouldeſt have ſome goodneſſe come from mee, to the end that thou mighteſt ſee I did acknowledge that thy goodneſſe; but I obeyed that traytour Satan, thy enemy, more willingly, and more readily than thee, when I might with more eaſe have contemned his ſlights than I can now thoſe foreſaid poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are mixed in my draughts, and that even by my friends; I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I am undone, I have neglected my perfection, O ſad and mournfull change!

               <p> Of Mans departing from God; of the ſubtilties of Satan; the omnipreſence and Clemency of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THou art wonderfull O God, and very much to bee praiſed, thy power is great, and there is no ſumming up of thy greatneſſe and goodneſſe, beneficence, and clemency. Though but a man, I will confeſſe thee; though I am but one piece of thy Creation, and but a man that carries his mortality about him, and that beares within him a teſtimony of his ſinnes; though ſuch a man, ſuch a portion of thy Creation; yet will I praiſe thee. If I were without thee, I ſhould not be, whatſoever I am, I ſhould become nothing. Thou waſt in mee to make me have a being, and to be with thee; but I departed from thee, although I am thus in thee, and with thee. But how could I depart or be abſent from thee? how could I fly from thy face? if I aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thou waſt there; for thence didſt thou caſt downe headlong the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of pride and authour of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10247:15"/> if I ſhould make my bed in hell, thou wouldeſt be there alſo, for thou haſt the keyes thereof, and ſetſt open the gates thereof, for them that truſt not in thee; if I ſhould plunge my ſelfe in the depth of the Sea, thou wouldeſt there find mee, for thou didſt caſt diſobedient peeviſh <hi>Jonah</hi> into the maw of the whale; thou madeſt him there a priſoner 3 nights and 3 dayes, and then dideſt draw him thence, neither torne, hurt, or wounded: if alſo I ſhould take the wings of the morning, and make my habitation beyond the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Seas, even there would thy hand lead mee, and thy right hand take hold upon mee; if I ſhould ſay, yet ſhall the darkneſſe hide me; why, even night ſhall be turned into day unto me; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe cannot hide from thee, the night to thee ſhines like the day; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is light, and light as darkneſſe; not houſes, nor vailes, nor walls, nor encloſures, no caves that are under ground, or dens that are full of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, can ſhut out thy preſence; thou art more nearely preſent with us, than we are to our ſelves. Thou ſearcheſt through our life, our actions and all our thoughts. Can any lurking place
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10247:16"/> hide any from thy preſence? Doeſt not thou fill heaven and earth, and art a God at hand, and alſo afarr off? Thou art all eye, for thou ſeeſt all things; all eare, becauſe thou heareſt all things; all hand, for thou frameſt all things; all foot, for thou art every where preſent; thou art neare me, thou art with me, thou art in mee, thou ſitteſt within mee, thou art an obſerver of all my good and evill, and art my protector; yet my God I went from thee, I departed, and forſook thee; <hi>I</hi> bluſh when I ſpeak this; yet I ſpeak it willingly; becauſe forthwith, thy mercy offers it ſelfe vnto me. Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that keep not their ſtations, are puniſhed with death, and hee that in the battell firſt begins to runne, loſes his life: yea for a man but to loſe his target, is counted a crime, and to caſt away his weapons is counted a moſt reproachfull thing. Ah! how foulely have I left my ſtation, without thy command O heavenly &amp; eternall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: there was yet no ordered or marſhalled battell with Satan, I was but only aſſailed by a light skirmiſh, and at the very firſt onſet, I threw away the buckler of my integrity, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10247:16"/> faith, I ſuffered my weapons to bee ſhaken out of my hands, and I fled from my allegeance, from before thy face. With what a ſlight reſiſtance, and by how childiſh a valour might I have overcome Satan? it was my ſloath, and not his force that made him ſtrong. As a man greedy of gaine, ſeeing an orphant have riches, entices him often to his houſe, makes him a banquet, beſtowes ſomething on him, and beguiles him with faire words, till hee hath gotten his meanes: ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſeeing that I had a pretious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, heavenly wiſdome, layd up in an earthen cheſt, preſently offered mee wealth, pleaſures and honours, that baited with theſe, hee might ſpoyle mee of my heavenly riches; he hath ſtripped mee and ſpoyled mee of all my treaſure which I ought to have kept holily, and might without difficulty have done it. But what gave he me in requitall? what riches? what pleaſures? what honours? What can he repay whoſe inheritance, and riches, is that infernall torment? that gulfe that vomits forth pitch, and flames, whoſe torments are without end, and his confuſion ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. But thou my God for my
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10247:17"/> backſliding haſt rendered a reaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of me; for my falling from thee, thou haſt requited mee with thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For thy grace and mercy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent and greater than my whole offence and all my failings. I read it ſpoken by thy Kingly ſervant that thy mercy is great; great hee ſaid it was, but how great hee could not tell: wee have knowne that it is great, but how great we have not knowne nor can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. We know not the quantity of it's greatneſſe, which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in words. Wee ſee the fruit of mercy is great, for were it not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond meaſure, we had not after our Fall been received of thee. Ah what is ſinne to the mercy of God? A ſpiders web that a blaſt of wind makes inviſible. Conſider a ſpark of fire if it ſhould fall into the Sea, could it continue living, or viſible? as a ſpark to the Sea, ſo is mans malice to Gods Pitty and Clemency; yea not ſo on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but farre leſſe; for the Ocean though it be vaſt, yet is not unmeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but of Gods mercies there is no meaſure.</p>

            <p>WHat is man that thou waſt mindfull of him? what the ſon of man that thou didſt viſit him?

Thou God and Father, who art the beginning and originall of the Trinity, with whom conſultedſt thou? was it with the Angels, and thoſe holy Inhabitants of heaven? why ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they joyned not with thee in the Creation of man, nor was man made according to their ſimilitude.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10247:18"/> thou, we our ſelves will be buſie about him, and not an Angell, not the Earth, not the Sunne, not the Water, nor any other thing. But who is with thee? doeſt thou ſpeak in the Potentates language? Nor was this ſutable; thou ſpeakeſt to thy Coeternall and Coeſſentiall Son and holy Spirit; thou ſpeakeſt God with God, one God; as the Father workes, ſo works the Son, and holy Ghoſt, they work but one. Thou createdſt man the worke of the whole Trinity, to live in this world, better than the whole world, the moſt exquiſite Creature of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the moſt abſolute Creature, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle world, the Compendium, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the great world; yet not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a world, but a man framed by thy hands, by the Communion of the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, an image enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the breath of thy mouth, and a repreſentation of thy ſelfe. Heaven, thy habitation, is reſplendant with ſhining, and ſparkling lights; the earth thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole doth ſwell with a thouſand ſort of fruits, and yet none of them is ſaid to be made as man was. O God, I am thy Image, I am thy likeneſſe, therefore I will be thy pleaſure, thy delight, thy content; thou wilt take care of me, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10247:18"/> never forſake me; for who will neglect an image, and a worke made after his owne likeneſſe? To what end O my God, haſt thou done all this? why didſt thou forme and faſhion me in ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a manner? Thou madeſt man firſt of al, that he might be the ſtock of us all from which ſo many branches, ſo many leafes, and ſo many fruits ſhould ſpring. Thou wouldeſt that all ſhould have one originall, and a like beginning, that no man ſhould preferre himſelfe before another, as if he were the ſeed of a more noble father; that none ſhould deſpiſe another, that one ſhould not hurt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that we ſhould every one mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually aſſiſt each other in his labour; that we ſhould be all of one mind, will the ſame thing, covet, and deſire the ſame thing; and that there might not be heard any brawles, contentions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſſe, or deceits amongſt us. For concord is that moſt fragrant Balſum that breathes thee that excellent odour. Thouſand thouſands in heaven do ſerve thee, and there is found no diſcord: thouſand thouſands ſhould alſo ſerve thee on earth, and there ſhould be found no diſcord. Thou didſt make us all that we ſhould be the cleere mirrour of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10247:19"/> thy Majeſty, of thy Glory, of thy Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of thy Power, and of thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The work commends the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the effect ſhewes the cauſe. O unſpeakeable Artiſt! O unvaluable cauſer of all things! Let us take heed that we neither break nor ſpot, that we nor fully nor make dusky this glaſſe; let us beware that we cauſe not Satans vizard to be ſeene in this glaſſe, but let wiſdome, piety, goodneſſe, curteſie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, and whatſoever is moſt excellent in thee, in part reflect in us. Thou madeſt us all, that wee ſhould bee the worlds perfection, beauty, and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The world was a Cage cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wonderfully wrought, but it wanted a ſinging bird, by whoſe warb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling notes al things might be expreſſed: let us wordlings beware, that we be not to the world like a Crow, or dunghill bird, or a Jay, but a Lark, that doth night and day, in the evening, and at morne celebrate and proclaime his Creatours praiſe: let us not be a diſgrace, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, and reproachfull burden, that the world may labour to expell with groans, and be glad, not ſorry to be rid of it, rather than wiſh for its returne. Thou haſt made us all that we ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10247:19"/> admire, and ſet forth thee, and thy works. Thou haſt endued me with an underſtanding enlightned with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire, that by thy ſelfe I might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh thee from my ſelfe, and the world. Thou haſt given me a will, that knowing thee, I might love thee above all things, becauſe thou excelleſt all things, and doſt comprehend all good things within thee. Thou gaveſt me a tongue, that knowing, and loving thee, I ſhould lively expreſſe, and redouble thy praiſes.

               <p> Of Paradiſe and of caſting forth of Man from thence.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>OMnipotent Creatour, thou dideſt beſtow a threefold grace upon man, the grace of the ſoule, originall righteouſneſſe: and the grace of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, immortality: and the grace of a moſt pleaſant place to inhabit: but what is that place my God, wherein thou dideſt place my firſt parent, and mee in him? I read the words of thy penman, but what meane thoſe words? what is Paradiſe? what is Eden? teach me O my God, for no man (although hee think he hath gotten much knowledg) can inſtruct me ſufficiently. I collect that thou plantedſt a garden, and that it looked toward the Eaſt; I heare of foure rivers, Ganges, Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates, but yet I am not ſatisfied: for the doubts of Diſputants, and their wrangling, makes the matter very intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate unto me. But why doe I ſeeke for that which is not, and neglect that which is? give me the heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and the earthly Paradiſe ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver trouble me. I underſtand it was a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10247:21"/> moſt fruitfull Garden, and ſtuffed with joy, pleaſure, and delight, in which the eyes did want nothing, nor the ears, or any other part of that body, which it did not enjoy. Within, thou hadſt furniſhed man with wiſdome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; without, thou ſufferedſt him not to want any thing: All the creatures came about that new king, enthroned by the King of kings, did tender him homage, and did reverence him with humble ſubjection. The tall, fertile, odoriferous, pruned, comely, and pregnant trees, how much did they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him? the Alder tree, Almond tree, Cherry tree, Fig tree, Cidonian Punick aurea, and what ever elſe doe beautifie the fields? But above the reſt, notable are thoſe two, which thy booke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes unto me, which did moſt of all ennoble the Garden, that Tree of life, and the Tree of the knowledge of good and evill. When thy faithfull ſervant calls it the Tree of life, doth he doe it becauſe it had received this power from thee, that he which ſhould eat of its fruit, ſhould have his body confirmed in a ſetled ſtate of health, and a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtrength, that it ſhould not decline to worſe, or to death by ſickneſſe, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10247:21"/> of age? Thy very Word doth intimate thus much unto me. Our firſt Parents were nouriſhed with the fruits of the other trees, that their living bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould not ſuffer hunger or thirſt: but therefore they were to taſte of the tree of life, that death might not creepe upon them from any ſide, nor that they ſhould (in continuance of time) periſh by reaſon of old age; the other trees were for nouriſhment; that for a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How great was thy care my God, how great thy providence? thou gaveſt me not a momentany pleaſure, nor a yearely, but an everlaſting. Now I am weakned by diſeaſes, I am tormented with cares, I am tortured with griefe, but this is beſides thy will, though not contrary unto it; for what could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to me againſt thy Will? could one haire have fallen from my head if thou hadſt not willed it ſhould be ſo? what was now my firſt habitation? the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and dark part of the womb, where I was environed with the ill ſented ſides of the belly. I come crying into this life, I depart out of it with ſweat, and I paſſe through it with labour, nor is there any one that can boaſt himſelfe free from this condition: being borne and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10247:22"/> brought into this light, I cannot move my ſelfe from one place to another; in my firſt infancy, I am void of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I am a burden both to my ſelfe and unto others, and expoſed to innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dangers, even till I attaine to theſe yeares wherein reaſon and judgement begin to floriſh in me, happier in that one thing than in the other part of my life, that I underſtand not my unhappy condition. What ſhall I ſay, O my God, my yeares are multiplyed, and my cares increaſe, but I was not even worthy of theſe things. Thou canſt not doe otherwiſe than lead me, and ſupport me with thy hand, although I did not deſerve life, but hell, and deſtruction, when I had opened my impious mouth and devoured the forbidden fruit: thou didſt ordeine the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, for my Altar, and Temple, that I ſhould yeeld thee due obedience in abſtaining from the fruit thereof; I would be made wiſer, and did become moſt unwiſe; before the Fall I had the knowledge and experience of a preſent good, I had only the knowledge but not the experience of an abſent evil: but after the Fall there was in me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of a loſt good, but no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10247:22"/> experience of it, and I had a knowledge an experience of an adherent evill. Woe is mee; when ſhall I returne thither, whence I am expelled? I deſire not a garden, but a houſe; not a figure, but the thing figured; I deſire not to rule, but to become a ſervant; I aske not to ſit, but to ſtand and obſerve thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Looke on mee, O my Father, looke on me, and approve me, and be pleaſed in thy mercy, that I may finde favour in thy ſight, that the dores of thy palace may bee opened unto mee when I knock; I beſeech thee by my Lord, thy Sonne, the man of thy right hand, the Sonne of man, whom thou haſt eſtabliſhed for a Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene thy ſelfe and me, by whom thou ſoughteſt me when I ſought thee not, that I might ſeeke thy Word by which thou haſt made all things, and mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt; thy onely Sonne, by whom thou haſt called thy beleeving people unto thy adoption, and amongſt them me alſo: I beſeech thee by him that ſits at thy right hand, and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede unto thee for me, in whom are hidden all the treaſures of wiſedome, and knowledge, open quickly unto me, and grant me paſſage (O my God) that

               <p> Of the Serpent the Deceiver.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe devill is wicked, foule, and terrible; hee doth therefore as much as he is able, hide his own face, and puts on a ſtrange countenance; yet all his thoughts, all his endevours, and all his actions, are to deceive; when hee perſwades to good, hee deceives, for a greater miſchiefe that is to ariſe from that good, in perſwading unto evill under the ſhew of goodneſſe; in diſwading from good, as if it were evill: in diſwading from evill, that he may bring in a worſe evill. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver invades the Serpent, that wee might not diſcover the hidden fraud, that hee might with more eaſe, and profit bring to paſſe that which hee had wickedly, and moſt cunningly projected: The Serpent was a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſubtile creature, therefore not unfit to entice, to move, to perſwade, and to ſeduce. O thou deceiver, O
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10247:23"/> thou turne-coate, O thou enſnarer, and deceiver: moſt lying ſpirit, thou tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt thy ſelfe into an Angel of light, that thy ſubtilty and ſlights of darknes ſhould not be diſcerned; thou diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt the night of thy malice, that wee might promiſe to our ſelves goodneſſe from that which is moſt vile, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thou mouldeſt, and painteſt, deckeſt, and faſhionſt thy inſtruments, that they may finde ſome time for acceptance with us; if thou ſhouldeſt rranſforme thy ſelfe into an enraged lyon, or wert ſo bold to change thy ſelfe into a cruell Beare, who would not tremble, take heed, and flie from thee? thou goeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us therefore moſt comely and moſt courteouſly, that thou mayeſt, without being perceived, finde admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of thoſe that are heedleſſe; yea, and oftentimes alſo of thoſe that are moſt wary. What are thoſe vile teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whoſe conſciences are feared, that glitter in ſo many ceremonies, ſo many formes of worſhip, and ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries or expoſitions of things, but ſerpents? but broods of vipers, that cunningly bite us? they put on ſheeps cloathing, that they may cover their wolviſh clawes. Thou old Serpent,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10247:24"/> thou uſeſt the ſubtill wits of men, which are the fitteſt of all for thy deſires; the ſimple, humble, and abject doe ſeldome broach Hereſies. He that hath profited much in knowledge, for the moſt part, attributes much to himſelfe; he avoides the beaten way, wherein the credulous common ſort of Chriſtians doe walke; and is wiſe apart, and departs, to fall headlong into the gulph of errors. Give me, my God, moderate wiſedome, but that I may profit exceedingly in a holy life, and in ſaving faith: thou wilt not aske mee hereafter what I have ſcene, but what I have beleeved; not what I have read, but what I have done. Grant that I may receive with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, what thou offereſt mee, and ſetteſt forth in thy Word; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding what either ſuperſtitious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the miſchievouſly obtuſe pitch of wit, and fooliſh ſubtilties of Doctors doe argue. Thou art the mouth of truth; grant that I may beleeve what thou ſpeakeſt; the Divell is the mouth of vanity; grant that what he lyingly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be ſuſpected and avoided by mee. Grant I may valiantly reſiſt and oppoſe him in fighting with him. Hee is a ſerpent, if he but once gaine but a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10247:24"/> little intermiſſion, hee crowdes him ſelfe in, and wee can hardly expell him but though wee overcome him, as it were, hee doth recollect himſelfe, and aſſayes to get new ſtrength; even as the ſerpents taile cut off, doth by licking grow againe; and if his head get in any where, all his body will quickly follow. O thou Conquerour of the Serpent, who art not ſaid to bruiſe his tayle, but breake his head, helpe me that I yeeld not: if I be ſtricken, if I doe fight with him, grant me alſo power, O my God, to trample under my feet ſerpents, and ſcorpions, and all the power of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, that nothing may doe me hurt. Vouchſafe, holy Trinity, but one God, that I may alwaies be mindfull of thee, that I may alwayes have thee with me; and all the power of Satan ſhall vaniſh away. The ſerpent is afraid of the three leaved graſſe, and never lyes upon it; Satan abhorres thy name and memory, and to call upon thee; nor dares ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the adorers of the Trinity, nor thoſe that inhabit neere the Deity. Bee preſent with me, O God, forſake me not my Redeemer. The ſerpent flyes the Hart, he is driven away by the fume of the fat, and of the Harts-horne; thou
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10247:25"/> art the morning Hart, thou art that fume, that odour whereby that infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſpirit is weakned and repelled. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move farre from me gluttony, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy. The ſerpent cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a faſting man's ſpittle, but dyes being ſprinkled with it; make mee poure out my prayers with faſting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and that I may ſend forth my ſighes, and call forth my groanes, and I ſhall be preſerved in ſafety. I often think of that (O my God) which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards I diſlike of; yet I confeſſe thoſe things unto thee, becauſe thou ſeeſt them, though I confeſſe them not unto thee; and except I doe confeſſe them, thou doſt puniſh them; I often deale thus with my ſelfe. Oh that I had bin ſo made, that I could not have fallen and been deceived. I thinke of good in an ill manner, I therefore thinke of thoſe things, that thou mighteſt never have been wroth with mee, nor that I might have given thee cauſe to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; this had been good, but I think it in an ill way; for why haſt thou not made me ſo? becauſe thou wouldſt not; why wouldſt thou not? becauſe thou wouldſt not; I muſt not bee more wiſe than is ſitting for me. But I ſuppoſe that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10247:25"/> creature is not of a little good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who avoides ill, by comparing of evills. Thou didſt not O God, violently hinder mans Fall, becauſe thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt how to draw ſome good from it; yet followes it not from thence, that thou didſt will his Fall, but didſt rather will that good which thou kneweſt how to derive from his Fall; but the Fall it ſelfe thou didſt hate, and extremely deteſt. What ſhall <hi>I</hi> thinke my God? pardon him that hath been deceived thereby: mee thinks thy ſervants are not to be accounted faithfull, and thrifty, if they muſt be fettered, and ſhackled, to force them to doe thy pleaſure; but when they freely, and of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords do manly act that which belongs unto them. That is not acceptable unto thee, which is forced, and drawne from us by violence, but that which proceeds from true virtue; for virtue proceeds from a free deliberation, not from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity but free deliberation, and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, require a freedome of will. But why doe <hi>I</hi> diſpute O my God? let it ſuffice me that thou didſt not produce a nature not ſubject to ſinne, becauſe it pleaſed thee not to doe it. Pardon me, pardon me, O my God, and deny not to forgive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10247:26"/> my curioſity. We ſhould not exerciſe our ſelves in an idle and vaine curioſity concerning the creatures, but we ſhould direct our ſteps to things immortall, and which indure for ever. Thoſe things which thou wouldſt conceale, are not to be ſearched into. Thoſe things which thou haſt revealed, are not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that we be not found unlawfully curious in the one, and damnably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull in the other; <hi>I</hi> will ſeek truth in truth, not in vanity; <hi>I</hi> will finde it when <hi>I</hi> have ſought it, for truths ſake, not for vanity; nor will <hi>I</hi> traffique for the gaine of death in the words of life.</p>

Moſt powerfull and wiſe God, whatſoever thou didſt once make, that thou doeſt alwayes preſerve, by thy Omnipotency; and doſt order it by thy wiſdome. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the nature of thy viſible creatures, their place, order, condition, motion; agreements, harmony, comelineſſe,

Think with thy ſelf my moſt ſweet ſoule, who it is that orders heavens axeltree that in ſo many thouſand yeers it's not growne old, nor hath received any alteration; and although it be made of a paſſible and corruptible ſubſtance: yet by the word of it's creation, it remaines ſtill upheld in the ſame ſtate; O Lord our God, there is none like unto thee. There is none ſo rude, nor of ſo bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh a behaviour, but if he lift up his eyes towards heaven, although he may be ignorant, whoſe providence it is that governes all this that hee ſees; yet that doth not underſtand from the very order, conſtancy, moderation and profit of theſe things, that there

Though wee ſhould find ſome living creatures, in regard of their uſe, unprofitable, and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to no fit uſe for us; yet might wee receive profit, in beholding them; and they might be more profitable to their hearts that behold them, than to the eyes of thoſe that uſe them.

Thou ſinfull and fallen man, why art thou proud in ſetting forth thy impieties? thou thiefe, why braggeſt thou of a halter? why doſt thou vauntingly boaſt of anothers fleece? what carrieſt thou under it, but a ſack full of dung, the rotten bag of thy ſoule? thy skin is not enough to cover thee; nor except thou beeſt moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, doſt thou let any one ſee it, but getteſt ſome other thing to ſupply the want of thine owne. I behold mine owne clothes, I ſee a hell of evills; yet I conſider the depth of thy care, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and mercy; for thou helpeſt mee thus naked, before I can underſtand mine owne want and nakedneſſe; and commandeſt all the creatures to haſte unto me, that they might cover my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and ſupply my wants. Thou thy ſelfe moſt mercifull God, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, didſt clothe ſinnefull man in a Lambs skinne, not in Lyons, Beares, Foxes, or Wolves skins, that thou mighteſt teach him thy hatred to cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, greedineſſe, deceit, and wrath, and thy love to unſpotted ſimplicity; thou madeſt his garment of the skins of dead cattell, that thou mighteſt ſhew us, how we were fallen from life to death; how
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10247:31"/> of immortall we were become mortall; that we were from the earth, and muſt returne to the earth againe. Thou took<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a skin of a Lamb ſlaine, that thou mighteſt witneſſe unto us, that our Fall was only to bee healed by a Lambe to be ſlaine. O thou garment of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den age! thou unſpotted Lamb, ſlaine to the beleevers before the beginning of the world. O thou Meſsias that waſt promiſed, and food appointed from all eternity; thou who waſt made the ſeed of the Woman, and haſt bruiſed the Serpents head: cloath me with thy merits, and mine owne deſerts ſhall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hurt mee; cloath mee with thy righteouſneſſe, and mine owne unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe ſhall not condemne mee; cloath me with thy holineſſe, and mine owne iniquity ſhall not accuſe mee; cloath me with faith in thee, and I ſhall one day receive the robe of happineſſe. Nothing can cover the filthy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a ſinner; nothing can hide me from Gods judgement, but thy coat, O heavenly Lambe, but the holes of thy wounds, but the yawning ſcarres of thy body; I will put thee on by a ſteadfaſt faith, and with the Church of old I will triumph before thee.</p>

Mans malice was great, and every thought of his heart was continually bent to miſchief; they neglected thy Word, nor did they obey thy Spirit that was to lead them; thou therefore didſt repent thee of thy Creation, and didſt reſolve to deſtroy this Inne of the World, with all the gueſts thereof: yet did not thy juſtice haſte very much to execute judgement, but thy mercy interpoſed a hundred and twenty yeares, that thou mightſt ſee whether by often preaching, any could be moved to worke repentance. Ah my God, thou goeſt with two feet, one of juſtice, the other of mercy; but mercy alwayes makes the firſt ſtep, and juſtice the later; nor doſt thou delight in the death or deſtruction of a ſinner, but thou wilt, and commandeſt that he bee converted and live.

If the heart of man bee not fixed in that eternall place, it can never be firme, but more wavering than motion it ſelfe, paſſing from one thing to another, ſeeking reſt where there is none to be found; for if his captive affections be taken up in theſe tranſitory, and vaine things, he can finde no true reſt, becauſe the ſoule is of ſo great a value, that nothing but the chiefe good can content it: enter therefore (O my ſoule) into <hi>Bethel,</hi> goe into the houſe of thy God, dwell in the high place, accompany thy God.

He ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, becauſe hee aſſumed our humane nature into the unity of his Perſon, and the branch of <hi>Ieſſe</hi> ſprang from the earthly Virgin. Thou my God, willing of old to heale man (the King of all thy creatures) of his ſinne, didſt make as it were thy bleſſed Sonne in a ſort to goe back from the excellency of the Divinity, and by extreme humility, having paſſed over nine degrees, thoſe nine orders of Angels, to deſcend by the incarnation, unto the tenth degree, even the humane nature.

The top of this Ladder did touch the heaven, but thou the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah doſt not only touch heaven, and art from thence to come unto us, and haſt from all eternity taken thy paſtime therein, but haſt alſo framed it; thou, who haſt neither beginning nor end of dayes, for yeſterday, to day, and for ever, art thou the firſt and the laſt, the great, the true, and bleſſed God, who waſt in the beginning, and waſt glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Father before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was layd. But the Ladder was but one that did reach from earth to heaven; ſo thou O moſt ſweete Jeſus art Lord of heaven, and a man of the earth, yet but one Perſon, but one Man, one God, and one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour between a diſpleaſed God, and a wretched man, by the union of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and humane nature. By this Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Angels aſcend, and deſcend; becauſe Angels deſire to look into the myſtery of ſo holy, and admirable an union, who notwithſtanding, doe alwayes ſee, and heare the holy Spirit inſtructing them.

Oh with how many teares and ſighes, they fill the earth, all which doe as it were by a certaine fate accompany mans life? he deplores the ſickneſſes, which poſſeſſe this his body; he deplores the uncertaine condition of his health, and the ambiguity of his life. For what Age or Time is there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee is not thwarted by ſome evill? doth he not ſo ſoone as he is borne, and newly pulled from the moiſt receptacles of the womb, abound with ſlime and filth, and make all things ring with his bawling cries? after, if hee live to the flower of his age, he is carried violently by his intemperate heate; if he attaine to his youth, by reaſon of the ardor and violence of his ſpirit, he cannot be kept within the bounds of his duty by no counſell, or admonitions; if he live to his old age he then dies and withers by little and little; yet all this is not enough; for what Art could man ever yet finde out, either to divert a plague, or to ſtop the force of violent rayns falling

I ſee a ranke and mutuall ſucceſſion of evills, and I behold a continuation of dangers: But if I come to the ſoule, I ſee even there an army of diſeaſes, by which it is beſieged; if I ſhall wipe away griefe, feare comes in its place; if feare retire, anger ariſeth; if anger bee appeaſed, envy comes in its roome; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is at hand, and evils are neere; nor doth ever any certaine reſt befall us. Alas, alas, miſerable creatures that wee are, how often is man even brought to nothing? I am aſtoniſhed when I ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on theſe things, and I poure forth my heart like water; I am not contented with ſmall drops of teares, but poure forth ſuch plenty, as the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and ſwift running ſtreame is wont to doe; I can no where finde eaſe, nor ever peace, nor can I finde any where comfort, but when I flie to thee my God my Fatherly God; for thou pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt forth thy goodneſſe night and day, without ceaſing. As it is the property of heate to warme, and of cold to coole: ſo is it thy property, good God, to doe that which is good. I am ſurely a wretch, and ſufficiently afflicted; yet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10247:38"/> thy goodneſſe, thy beneficience, thy care, hath overcome all my miſery, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſheth, and utterly brings to nothing all my affliction.

But I am exceedingly refreſhed, and I am tranſported with wonderfull joy, when I conſider that thou art alwaies

Although many that belong to thee, do behold the poſterity of Iſrael often murmuring, and curſing; yet is hee a rejoycing vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious rock, amidſt all the greateſt dangers he is invironed withall: He is oppreſſed, vexed, troubled, and almoſt overwhelmed; but my helping God comes in ſeaſon to his ayde, to deliver thoſe that mourne.

And what? after this he rebells ten times, and is ſo many times puniſhed.

But what followed all this I have ſaid? Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is let to depart, doth celebrate the Paſſeover, doth rob the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and goes thence with great riches. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> repents him, muſters an army, overtakes them in their flight; his army is ſtopped, hee is divided from them by darkneſſe, the ſea is dried up, Iſraell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth he is delivered by the officious patience of the waves; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> follows after them, the ſea returneth upon him, and hee is ſwept away by the working waves. In order after theſe things, the Hebrew Nation, that had conquered without warre, enters the wilderneſſe, and journeyth without travel, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth without a way: God uſhering them; they honourable in having God a fellow-ſouldier with them; and being mighty, by his heavenly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance following the moving Pillar, cloudy by day, and fiery in the night; uſing fit diſtinctions of colours for the

Thou addeſt O wonderfull, bountifull and mercifull God, Fountains ſpringing in a moment: thou addeſt the healed waters, either given, or altered; keeping their forme, but leaving their nature. Thou giveſt them tops of mountains with ſtreames guſhing out; thou makeſt their duſty fields flow with new ſtreames; thou giveſt them multitudes of quailes, brought to their tents, as they journyed. Thou God, moſt indulgent in pitty, thou giveſt man things not onely fit for his uſe, but baites to intice him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee: my God, thou loveſt and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheſt thy people, even with pleaſure, to thee; Thou aſſiſtedſt them forty yeares long, the ſtarres daily affording them food, and the dropping poles of heaven in like manner flowing with pleaſant ſuſtenance, not onely for livelihood, but even for their delight. Thou preſervedſt the men, without addition, or diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the parts of their bodies; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out growing of the nails, without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the teeth, the haire alwayes of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10247:40"/> one length, their feet not gauled, their garments without tearing, and their ſhooes without mending. The honour of thy ſervants doth abound even in the dignity of their vile Cloathing.

I heare God ſpeaking neere at hand, preaching the Law with his divine mouth; I view the letters graven with the finger of God, the learning people, and teaching God; and that there is as it were but one ſchoole of heaven and earth, mixed of men and Angels. For ſo it is written, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> had reported to the Lord the peoples words, the Lord ſaid unto him, Now will I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear me ſpeake to thee: And behold, a while after, they began to heare thunders, and lightnings, and thicke clouds began to cover the mountains. And again; He did deſcend upon the top of Mount Sinah; And afterwards he ſpake with <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10247:41"/> all of them ſeeing, that the Pillar of the Cloud did reſt at the doore of the Tabernacle, and they ſtood and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in their Tent doors. Thou didſt ſpeak, O Lord, to <hi>Moſes</hi> face to face, as one friend uſeth to doe with another. O what a care haſt thou of thy creature man, thou God that affordſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt theſe ſo great things for him: making vile man partaker of thy Word; and as it were admitting him to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of thy holy company, opening thy hands full of immortall riches, nouriſhing him with the cup of Nectar, and feeding him with heavenly food! What greater care, I beſeech thee, coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou performe in that thy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or what greater affection coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou uſe, that whereas they were but in the action of this preſent life, they did notwithſtanding then enjoy a repreſentation of their future bliſſe? Nor let any man here murmure, that thou hadſt this care of mankinde here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, but that thou now haſt it not. Whence ſhall I beleeve this repining doth proceed? by chance, becauſe we are not daily fed with Manna, as they were, although we reap from our fields moſt plentifull Wheat-harveſts? or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10247:41"/> wee catch not Quailes flying as it were, into our hands: whereas we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all kinde of birds, of cattell and beaſts? or becauſe we doe not with open mouthes receive the waters ſpringing from the rockes, whereas wee drench our Tavernes with the juice of the grapes? Somthing I adde more, that we our ſelves who thinke that God did then take care of them, and do ſuppoſe, that God doth now neglect us: if wee could exchange our preſent bleſſings for theirs, which are paſt; wee would utterly refuſe to wiſh to bee in their Condition. For we would not loſe the things wee now have, that wee might poſſeſſe the things which they then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Not that wee have better things than that Nation then had, but becauſe even they who were fed by the daily miniſtery of heaven, and of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; did preferre the old gluttony of their bellies, before the preſent good things they received; beeing ſad with the calling to minde of their carnall meates, and falling ſicke for the filthy love of leeks and oyons; not that theſe things which they formerly uſed were better, but becauſe even as we now do, ſo did they then; they loathed the things

We doe rather extol the things that were then, than the things which now are; not that we had alwayes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have them, if we might chooſe; but becauſe this is an uſuall fault, that mans ſoule is incident to; to deſire the things are abſent; and for other mens things to pleaſe us better than our owne; and for ours to pleaſe others more than the things they doe enjoy; ſo faſtidious are we, moſt miſerable men, that we are not worthy to live, much leſſe, of life with the good things appertaining to it. But what ere thou giveſt or denieſt, thou art alwayes a Father, and doſt never forſake a ſonne that truſts and hopes in thee. Give if thou wilt, but onely five loaves and two fiſhes; a handfull of meale, a little oyle in a pitcher, a few ſhreds, and branches of trees, and no more; I will boaſt of the care thou haſt of mee, O my God, in thee will I boaſt my heavenly Father, who takeſt me up, nor can I receive diſquietneſſe from thee, for ever. Thou wilt ſay to my ſoul, I am thy ſalvation; no good thing ſhall be diminiſhed to them that ſeeke thee: they ſhall not bee confounded in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill day, and in a time of famine they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10247:42"/> ſhall have enough. Although I fall, I ſhall not bee daſhed to peeces, becauſe thou ſetteſt to thine hand.

I will firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and other things ſhall be added unto me. It is ſo far from thee, my God and Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt forſake thine, that thou makeſt even dogs to helpe and give them eaſe. I will expect thee, O Lord, I will play the Man, I will ſuffer thine hand, O Lord, and my heart ſhall receive comfort; let my father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake mee, thou Lord ſhalt take mee up. O God thou ſhalt be my helpe, nor wilt thou deſpiſe me, O God my ſalvation.

In thy Tabernacle I ſee the Arke of thy Covenant; beſides the Arke, I ſee the

O my God, how many myſteries do here lie hid, that I would I might underſtand? mee thinks, I ſee Chriſt in all theſe things; for hee is the true Mercy-ſeat, who alone hath done away the ſinnes of the whole world, by the onely ſacrifice of his paſſion, and hath made thee a God propitious unto us. Hee was repreſented by that gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den peece of workmanſhip, wherein thou diddeſt promiſe that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt dwell, and hearken unto thoſe that ſhould call upon thee: for thou lovedſt us alſo in him thy beloved one; and in him art mercifull unto us. Hee defends his Church, as that golden tent did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Arke: and did hide the Law which was laid up in it from the face of God, that dwelt above it: that hee ſhould not according to the rigour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10247:44"/> thereof, take notice of our ſinnes, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into judgement with us. Thou thy ſelfe, my God, haſt promiſed him unto mee, that he might be a ſacrifice for me in his owne blood. Thou haſt made him a propitiation both for mine, and for the ſinnes of the whole world: O Chriſt my reconciler, my place of refuge, O my hope, redeeme mee and reconcile mee, that I loſe thee not, and bee forced to beare the wrath of my everlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ever.

With what elſe ſhall I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy incarnation, but to a kiſſe? a kiſſe, a token of peace and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by thy incarnation, was peace and reconciliation reſtored to the world. O what a bleſſed day is that, when thwarting thy paths I receive a kiſſe from thy offended mouth, in ſtead of a deſerved reproofe; as thy Spouſe the Church cries out, burning with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient love, ſhee cryes out, Let him kiſſe mee with the kiſſes of his mouth: with a deſire kindled from the promiſes and benefits of Chriſt, ſhe beſeeches the Meſſiah might be ſent unto her, that ſhe might heare him ſpeaking, and behold him inſtructing her: in his fleſh, ſhee requires him to deſcend, and to bee united to the humanity. Conſider the Church O my ſoule, who having (of a long time) had a promiſe of her Lords comming, from the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and having beene a great while in ſuſpence, raiſeth her ſelfe from the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10247:46"/> body; abandoning luxury, and carnall pleaſures, and delights, and diſroabing her ſelfe of the care of ſecular vanities, doth wiſh for the infuſion of the divine preſence, and grace of the ſaving Word; and how is ſhee tortured and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that hee comes ſo late? wounded as it were with love, not able longer to endure his delay, turning to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhee beſeecheth him, that he will ſend God the Word unto her. I will not have him ſpeak by <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor by the Prophets; no; let him take my body upon him, let him kiſſe me in the fleſh: Follow my ſoule, thou which art a part of that moſt happy aſſembly; follow the example of that groaning Church, and think on nothing more; love, cheriſh, vow unto, and expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than thy Meſſias. See, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and conſider, the familiar, and friendly communication of thoſe ſoules (ſighing in the fleſh,) with the heavenly powers; they rejoyce in thoſe kiſſes, they aske for what they deſire, yet they name not him they love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they doubt not, but that hee knowes them, with whom they have been accuſtomed (ſo often) to converſe withall; therefore they ſay not, let this
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:10247:46"/> or that particular kiſſe me, but only let him kiſſe us; as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did not expreſſe his name whom ſhe ſought, but only ſaid to him (ſhe thought had been the Gardner) Sir, if thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him; What him? ſhe utters it not, becauſe ſhe thought that muſt needs be manifeſt to all, which could not (for one moment) depart out of her heart; neither doth that betrothed Virgin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one kiſſe, burning continually with chaſte love, and impatient of delayes; but ſhe askes for many kiſſes, that her deſires may bee ſatiate. For ſhe that loves, is not content with the parcimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of one kiſſe, but requires many, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges many, and ſo uſeth to commend her ſelfe often unto her beloved. Kiſſe thou alſo the Lord, O my ſoule, leſt at any time he be angry, and thou periſh in the way. Who will give thee unto me, O Lord? O let me find thee, and I will kiſſe, not my hands, or any thing my hands can touch, but even thee, O Lord. Let the tumultuous fleſh be ſilent, let the phanſies of earth, and water, of ayre, and of the vault of heaven hold their peace; let dreams and imaginary revelations bee ſtill; let every tongue, every ſigne, and

For he is truly all my hope and truſt. For in God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt moſt ſweet, moſt bountifull, and moſt piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is every of our portions, our bloud and fleſh: the lover doth (as much as poſſible) deſire to be one with the thing beloved: and therefore they cling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and glew, as it were, their bodies in one, and they ſtrive to make, of both their ſoules, but one, by the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of kiſſes. Thou, O Jeſus, my love, thou my deſire, thou my thought, thou my hope, thou my wiſh, I would I could alwayes cleave unto thee. Would to God that where thou my portion doeſt raigne, there I may at leaſt be a ſubject, and where thou my blood doeſt rule, there I may obey, and where thou my fleſh art glorified, I may not bee there confounded. I am indeed a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but yet I diſtruſt not of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of grace; and if my ſinnes doe forbid it, yet my ſubſtance requireth it; if mine owne offences exclude me, the fellowſhip of my nature drives mee not back; for God is not ſo great an
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10247:47"/> enemie, that hee ſhould not love his owne fleſh, his members, and bowels. I might indeed deſpaire, by reaſon of my too too many ſinnes and offences, my infinite faults, and negligences, which I have committed, and which I daily, and without ceaſing doe act, in heart, mouth, and worke, and by all wayes that humane frailtie can offend, except thou haddeſt kiſſed me, except, O Word, thou haddeſt beene made fleſh, except thou ſhouldeſt dwell in me. Let reaſon here be ſilent, and let faith ſpeak; the things are true which I ſay, for thy Spirit hath revealed them unto me; yet are they ſo profound, that I cannot pierce into them; they are ſo high, that my abjectneſſe will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to reach them.

Our nature is not now ſtrange to God, ſince that in it, even in Chriſt our Mediatour the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Godhead doth now dwell; for the Virgins womb was made choice of for the Lord of heaven and earth to ſpring in; nor was that bleſſed maſſe, the Sonne of God incarnate for her onely; but that of his fulneſſe all wee might be made pertakers; God did not onely make mee, but hee made many things for me; ſeeing that the Word is made fleſh for me, and dwelleth in us, he is become one fleſh with me, that he

Ah what was the cauſe of Chriſts comming and Birth? what, but to ſave ſinners? Take away ſickneſſe, take away wounds, and there will bee no uſe for medicines. Therefore the great Phyſitian came from heaven, becauſe men lay ſicke in all places; all the ſtocke of mankind was loſt by the ſinne of one, in whom all were; and therefore came one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, that might ſave all that were in their ſinnes; for not our merits, but our ſinnes, drew him from heaven. It is a thing becomming our faithfull ſoules, Chriſtian breaſts, beleeving minds, that we celebrate the comming of our Lord with all devoutneſſe, and that we meditate of his Birth, being delighted wirh ſo great a conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and amaſed with ſo excellent a Dignity, and enflamed with ſo great a love.

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther names of the Meſſiah, are taken from the effects of his ſalvation, and doe onely ſignifie either the beginning, or middle, or onely the end of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but this name Jeſus, the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thereof; for it doth ſufficiently containe and expreſſe, the beginning, middle, and end thereof; and doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other things alſo within it. The Angels adore, and the devils doe tremble at this name, and men receive it for their ſalvations. This name is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the preaching of it; being thought upon, doth nouriſh us, called upon, doth mollifie and anoint us; not in the letters of it, but by its ſpirit and life. Whence could there have beene, in all the world, ſo great and ſo ſodaine a light of faith, but by the preaching of the name of Jeſus? Hath not God called us in the light of this name, into his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable light to ſuch as are ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and doe ſee light by his light? <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh deſervedly, <hi>You were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darkneſſe, but now are you light in the Lord.</hi> And the name of Jeſus is not onely a light, but it is alſo food: art not thou as often refreſhed as thou
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10247:52"/> doſt think upon it? What doth ſo much fatten the ſoule, as the thought of that name? What doth ſo much repaire the decayed ſenſes? It ſtrengthens our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it quickens good and honeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it cheriſheth chaſte affections, all meat is dry that is not moiſtned with this oyle, is unſavoury, not ſeaſoned with this ſalt. If thou writeſt to mee, I reliſh it not if thou leave out Jeſus; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is honey in the mouth, harmony in the eare, gladneſſe and phyſicke for the heart. Is any of us ſad? let Jeſus come into the heart, and thence let him flow into our mouths, and behold, at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the light of that name, every cloud is expelled, and the cleare light returnes: Doth any ſlip into ſinne? doth he haſte even to the halter of death by his deſpaire? doth he not by invocation of this name of life, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with reſpire to life? Surely there have beene many others who have had the name of Jeſus; for the name of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi> that led the Iſraelites through Jordan, into the land of Canaan, is the ſame name with Jeſus. The ſon of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> is called <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and <hi>Ieſus</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Zachary;</hi> but theſe men beare the name without the thing; or if they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10247:53"/> wrought any ſafety, they performed it by the power and helpe of this my Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. There were likewiſe many that were called Saviours, as <hi>Othniel, Ehud,</hi> and others; but theſe were onely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers of the body, and did onely for a time deliver the people from their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enemies, and did for a while keep them free from the ſpoylers of this world: but this my Jeſus is the true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, for he not onely frees and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth his people from outward ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but from ſpirituall ſubtilties in high places. Sometimes indeed he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us to outward enemies, nor is he preſently Jeſus or a Saviour; he ſends amongſt us warre, plague, haile, cold, poverty, diſgrace, diſeaſes, captivity, bondage, but it is for our eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He is alſo a faithfull Jeſus, nor ſuffers he any one to be tempted above his ſtrength, but giveth our temptations ſuch a meaſure, that we may endure them; and although our Jeſus doth ſeeme too cruelly and too long to leave us in theſe externall evils, and to lay too heavie a burden upon us, that we are in feare to be overcharged, to yeeld, and to faile under it; yet let us expect the comming of our Jeſus, wwhich will be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10247:53"/> in a fit ſeaſon. My Jeſus beſt knoweth our ſtrength, and how much we can beare; and as the pilot doth diligently take care that the ſhip be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraighted, or fall into any fearfull dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſo my Ieſus doth weigh and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance our abilities, before he layes any croſſe upon us, that it may not exceed them. Thinke alwayes (O my ſoule) upon Ieſus, becauſe thou haſt alwayes need of thy Ieſus. If thy ſinnes do vex thee and Satan doth paint them forth, and ſet them before thee, that he may perſwade thee they are more in number than can be forgiven; that they be lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than heaven and earth for magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; call upon thy Ieſus, and make Satan thy laughing-ſtocke. Ieſus is my Saviour, who hath delivered me from my ſins, and hath taken them upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; he is become for me and all the world a ranſome, a ſacrifice, a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. And becauſe it appeares that he is not conquered, but is truly a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they muſt needs be ſinners indeed, and not feighned ſinners that he doth ſave; for this ſentence can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called; Chriſt is the Lambe of God that taketh away the ſins of the world. If the feare of death doth preſſe thee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10247:54"/> and if Satan endeavour to diſhearten thee with the expectation thereof, and doth portrait the figure of death before thee in a moſt bloody &amp; horrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and repeats unto thee the threats which God denounces againſt ſinners, and the vengeance which he reſerves for them, protect thy ſelfe with the Name of Ieſus, and oppoſe it to the terrors of death. Why ſhould I feare death, that I ſhould feare the paines thereof? when as my Ieſus (as himſelfe doth teach us) hath ſlaine my death; O death I will be thy death. Doth Satan ſtrive to make thee ſad, himſelfe being puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and overwhelmed with everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woe, deſiring to draw others into his company? pronounce thou therefore but the Name of Ieſus with beliefe, and he vaniſheth away; for hee is therefore a Ieſus, becauſe he hath ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed thee from the curſe of thy ſinnes, and hath reconciled thee to the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Father, that thou mighteſt for ever rejoyce with him. Why then art thou ſad? What ever befals thee, let the Name of Ieſus ſtill come into thy heart, and betweene thy lips, that the force thereof may aſſwage all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nothing is more ſweetly ſung, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10247:54"/> is heard more pleaſingly than Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Sonne of God. No kinde of ſin is ſo great, but the Name of Ieſus is above it; O thou (therefore) pleaſant Name of Ieſus, a delightfull Name, a comfortable Name; O Lord Ieſus, if I have done that for which thou mayeſt damne me, yet haſt not thou loſt that whereby thou mighteſt ſave me. O moſt mercifull Ieſus, O moſt ſweet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, O moſt gracious Ieſus, O Ieſu, Ieſu, O Ieſus the ſalvation of thoſe that truſt in thee, O Ieſus the ſalvation of thoſe that beleeve in thee, O Ieſus, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that flie unto thee, O ſweet Ieſu, the remiſſion of all our ſinnes, O Ieſu, for thy holy Name ſake ſave me, that I periſh not; O Ieſus have mercy upon me, while there is a time for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and condemne me not in the time of thy judgement. Ieſus Chriſt, have mercy upon me; for this thy Names ſake, doe unto mee according to this thy Name; looke on me miſerable wretch, invoking thy Name: it is true, my ſoule hath deſerved damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my repentance is no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it is certaine that thy mercy is farre exceeding all my offences; give me therefore (for thy Names ſake) that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10247:55"/> mercy, O my Ieſus; for thou ſaveſt thy people freely by faith alone, without all merit of works, onely for thy Names ſake, onely by the power of thy Name, onely by the blood of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereby thou diddeſt appeaſe thy Father, and obtainedſt redemption: and therefore doſt thou ſave thy people free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not for their works, that our ſoules might be ſure of redemption: it could not be ſure if thou ſhouldeſt not ſave us but for the merit of our works; for either we have no merits by manifeſtly ſinning againſt the Law of God, or we have not merits enough, becauſe our works are imperfect, which can by no meanes ſatisfie Gods Law; therefore that our conſciences may be ſure of the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, it is needfull that thou be a Ieſus gratis unto me: who ſeeing thou art true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in thy promiſes, it cannot be that I can be deceived, if I truſt in thy Name: O moſt bountifull Ieſus, O Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu my moſt ſweet Lord, keep me in this faith and confidence, even to the end: let thy laſt word upon the croſſe, be my laſt word in this life, and when I can ſpeak no more, heare my laſt deſire, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my

Why doeſt thou ſo haſten, O Lord, to the ſhedding of thy milky blood? it is my ſalvation which makes thee thus to haſten: but why didſt thou ſubmit thy ſelf to be circumciſed, which

What need I to reckon up many things? thou waſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed for the cauſe that thou waſt borne and for which thou didſt ſuffer: none of all this was for thy ſelfe, but all was for thy Elect, for mee, for all that cleave unto thee, that thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pay for us thoſe debts, even thou that didſt owe nothing thy ſelfe, and mighteſt free us from our owne, and from the offences of others. O moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jeſus, I adhere to thee, doe thou everlaſtingly ſtick to me; I have runne into debt, doe thou pay them.

Give me, O Lord, the Circumciſion of the heart, which is, that the cloud of errour being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to acknowledge the Creator, God the Father, and his Sonne Chriſt, by whom he hath created all things, that the truth of God might be fulfilled; grant that I may cut off, and caſt out of my heart all uncleanneſſe of thoughts, and impuritie of my ſenſes. For the Goſpell hath not enjoyned cutting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the Prepuce, but the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heart, and that by the Sword of the Spirit wee ſhould cut away all petulancie, as well of our members, as of our affections: this Circumciſion is

I am preſent, O Lord, as thou haſt commanded by thy faithfull ſervant <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Be circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Lord, and take away the fore-skinne of your hearts, that my wrath break not forth like fire. Give me that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me; Thou art circumciſed with a Circumciſion which is made without hands, if thou put off the body of ſins by the Circumciſion of Chriſt. The Iewes circumciſed but one member of the body; grant, O Lord, that I may circumciſe all my members. The heart of man is wicked, it muſt therefore be circumciſed, and the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to be unſheathed for it; and this is the preaching of the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt; which if any one receiveth into his heart by faith, firſt his ſinnes ſhall not be imputed to him, but he ſhall be accompted juſt for Chriſts ſake; then the holy Ghoſt ſhall bee given unto

Thou haſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this, O Lord, if thy right eye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee pluck it out and caſt it from thee. Stirre me up, O Lord, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then mee, that I may circumciſe my hands, that they be not enraged and ſhed innocent blood; for thou haſt commanded this, O Lord, if thy right hand offend thee cut it off. Stirre me up and ſtrengthen me, O Lord, that I may circumciſe my feet, that they goe not in the way of ſinners, and that they haſte not to doe evill; ſo putting off the old man, and putting on the new, I ſhall become a new creature, and ſhall poſſeſſe the inheritance of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, O Chriſt; I ſhall enjoy the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the citizens of heaven, the quire of Angels ſinging Hymnes unto thee, and the ſweet fellowſhip of all thy bleſſed ones.

Out of the conſideration of the remedy I value the meaſure of my danger; and ſo is the eſteeme of the medicine, as is the heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of my griefe and feare.

If I would reckon up what he ſuffered for moſt miſerable man, what voice would ſuffice me for it? what eares would not be weary to heare it? for he was no ſooner borne, but his blood was ſpilt in the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he was ſcarcely circumciſed, but forthwith was he deſigned to the ſlaughter; he no ſooner profeſſed his doctrine openly, but he was called the

After that the Son, coeternall and conſubſtantiall with his Father, the Omnipotent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of the Church, ordained for a judge of the quicke and the dead, had fervently powred forth thoſe prayers, which he had conceived for mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wherin he at the point of death more eſpecially recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that deare pledge, (his Church) for whoſe ſake he ſuffered not onely valiantly, but moſt willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not a drop, but ſtreames of blood to flow from his five wounds.

Behold the man;

Behold the man; behold the Lord of all things ſtands in want, amidſt all thoſe things which he doth poſſeſſe; he ſtandeth bound, who frees all; he ſtands wounded, that heales all. Behold the man; for thy cauſe, O man, ſtands he before the judge, before us all doth he ſtand for us all; he ſtands without a garment, he ſtands robbed, that no wound of his body might be hid from the beholders. Learn, O man, out of theſe things which he ſuffered for thee, what account Chriſt made of thee, to the end, by how much the viler thou art for whom he ſuffered, by ſo much the dearer thy Chriſt may be unto thee: Learne, O man, to avoid thoſe things which may offend thy God. Behold with how much ſweat, with what labour, with what griefe he ſtood, that he, the Son of God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thee to his Father.

O face of man, harder than a flint, that with dry eyes canſt read this ſtory: O heart of man, harder than an Adamant, that theſe things cannot penetrate: O fierce and ſteely heart of man, that conſiders not theſe things. Thy Saviour (being weary and overcharged under ſo great a burden) cries and cals out, and in his ſoule cals upon us, My people, what have I done unto thee? or how have I beene troubleſome unto thee? anſwer me: I have beene no Uſurer, nor hath any thorow the earth taken uſe for me, yet all doe curſe me; God hath ſhut me up with the wicked, and hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to the hands of the wicked. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny calves have compaſſed me about, fat buls have beſieged me. They opened their mouths upon me, as it were a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and roaring Lion.

Oh thy ſupereminent love, O Lord! thou prayeſt, not O Lord, that they might be puniſhed who afflicted and crucified thee; but that they might enjoy the merit of thy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and be ſaved.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10247:81"/> it were with a garment; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was thruſt into a moſt noyſome darkneſſe of a priſon, but the third yeere was hee taken thence, and made the great commander over all <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Chriſt was put in the bowells of the earth, but the third day he came out thence alive, and was made governour of heaven and earth. <hi>Moſes</hi> was caſt forth into the river, being ſhut into an Arke of bulruſhes; but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drawne from thence and made the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Captaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer. Chriſt Jeſus was ſhut into the tomb; but was in good time rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thence, and deſigned for a Saviour unto all men. The buſh in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, did burne, but was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the fire; Jeſus burned upon the Croſſe, and was expoſed to the flames of Gods wrath, and the aſſaults of Satan; but this fire was put out, and now the beames of his fatherly favour ſhine forth. <hi>Aarons</hi> rod was withered, but it flouriſhed againe; all Chriſts bones were dryed by his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but vigour returned to them, from the grave. <hi>Joſuah</hi> trampled the five Kings that were brought unto him under his feet, and hung them upon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10247:81"/> five trees; Jeſus Chriſt trampled upon our five enemies; the world, ſatan, ſinne, death, and the grave; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away moſt great ſpoyles, and ſet up glorious trophyes of his victory. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was taken in <hi>Gaza;</hi> but hee plucked up the gates of the City, and eſcaped. Chriſt Jeſus was taken of death, but not kept; and having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered death, hee triumphed. <hi>David</hi> overthrew <hi>Goliah</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, with a ſling: Chriſt with his blood overthrew and vanquiſhed the devill, the leader and captaine of the wicked. We bleſſe thee, famous Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, we laud thee, moſt invincible cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, we reverence thee moſt trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant victour; ariſe make haſte my ſoule, and come away; now winter's paſt, the ſtorme is over and gone, the flowers deck our feilds, the ſpring is come, the voyce of the turtle is heard in our land; the figgtree is bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the flouriſhing vines ſend forth a ſweet ſavour; ariſe make haſte my ſoule, and come away; it is no time for ſloth, but to make ſpeed; it is no time to ſleepe,, but to awake; it is no time to weepe, but to rejoyce; it is no time to complaine, but to bee

Confeſſe unto the Lord, and call upon his name, ſet forth his works amongſt the Gentiles, ſing unto him, ſing pſalmes unto him, declare all his wonderfull works. This is the day wherein hath fallen what ever lifted

Remember the wonderfull things of the Lord, which hee hath done, his marvailes, and the judgements of his mouth; who ſhall ſet forth the power of the Lord, and make all his praiſes to be heard? this is the day wherein did vaniſh away the ſnares of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of paradiſe, which hee layd for the ſeede of the woman; they vaniſhed away, and the head of the ſerpent, was cleft in ſunder, and the enmity betwixt mankinde and the ſerpents brood, brake forth into extreamity of deeds.

This, O my ſoule, was the voice and ſong of the faithfull Jewes in the old Teſtament, wherein they gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Saviour, when in ſpirit and in faith they ſaw he was to come, and did exhort one another, that they ſhould ſing unto, and truſt in him, that was exalted in his Majeſty. Say thou alſo O clap your hands, rejoyce in the Lord in the voice of exultation; that which they proclaimed in hope, doe thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime in fruition; for Chriſt is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the eternall offspring of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God, and the Sonne of temporary man borne in time. Sing, O my ſoule, to thy great God and Saviour, to the true peacefull Prince of peace, Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of heaven and earth, King of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10247:85"/> kings, Lord of lords. The Angels praiſe his Majeſty, Principalities adore him, Majeſties tremble at him, the powers of the heaven of heavens, and the Society of the bleſſed Seraphins doe celebrate his praiſes with exultation; doe thou alſo cry out, to thy Meſſiah be life and victory, bleſſing and honour, glory and power for evermore. Thoſe ſell ſoules, not ſatisfied with his death, torments, and Croſſe, did even warre againſt him being dead, and did moſt diligently obſerve all things, leſt any ſhould ſteale his body out of the grave; yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes he; the Conquerour returnes, cloathed with the brightneſſe of his glory, as it were with moſt pure gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he returnes, and haſtens to higher things, he flies up to the higheſt heavens, compaſſed with quires of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and heavenly citizens, ſome of whom (as I gueſſe) ſing ſongs of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph to the Conquerour, others dance for joy, others offer him palme and bayes, others ſtrew handfuls of a moſt pleaſing crop of heavenly flowers. Where are now thy pale lips? where is that filthy beſmearing with ſpittle? where is the congealed blood? where the pricks of the thornes? where his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10247:85"/> black and blew ſhoulders? where thoſe ſtreames of blood guſhing forth? where his torne ſinewes by the laſhes of whips? In ſo ſhort a moment is this ſo thicke a miſt of ignominy exhaled, and the brightneſſe of his glory poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all things. And now is the fore-head cleare, the eyes ſparkling, the comely cheeks bluſhing red; now are the lips died ſcarlet, now doth he ſhake his golden and glittering treſſes; in briefe, he is all over like the Sunne breaking out of a cloud. Where now Lord, is thy abjection, after thou haſt pierced the skies, and aſcended above all heavens, when thou waſt higher than the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and hadſt entred into thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, in which are many manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? where was thy contemptible eſtate, when the glory of the heavens gave place to thee, and thou ruledſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and filledſt all places from ſea to ſea, even to the ends of the earth, for evermore? Thou filleſt all things, O Lord, therefore art thou moſt preſent; and although thou ſeemeſt ſometime to be departed from us, yet if thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt open our eyes, we ſhould finde thee about us, and in us. Thou art moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; therefore let not my ſinnes defile
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10247:86"/> me, becauſe they offend thee that waſt ſcourged, crucified, and ſlaine for them, and cauſe me to be condemned for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of thee. Thou art cleane, and doſt dwell with thoſe that are pure in heart; thoſe that burthen their ſoules with the filth of ſinne, doe expell thee the gueſt of their ſoule. Thou art moſt preſent, therefore whatever betides me, and howſoever the devill batter me, and in what manner ſoever the world afflict me, or the fleſh doe tempt me, yet thou ſeeſt it, and art both able and joyfull to deliver me. When upon mount Olivet thou madeſt preparation to depart, to the full enjoying of thy heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, thou didſt hold up thy hands to heaven, and didſt bleſſe thy Diſciples; I am alſo thy diſciple, therefore thou wilt not withdraw thy bleſſing from me, but wilt make thy aſcention to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unto me a deſcention of many ſorts of gifts. Thy graces did deſcend, as thy body did aſcend: ſo ſhall I aſcend in my heart; I will runne after thee, not with the ſteps of my feet, but with the deſires of my ſoule; and flying from worldly deſires, I will follow thee thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heart, whither I beleeve thou art in body aſcended: let me now take no
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10247:86"/> pleaſure in vile things here below, that am poſſeſſed of thee in heaven. I will aſcend in my affections, I will aſcend in my progreſſe, and I wil aſcend in effect. I ſhall aſcend in my affections, if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh heavenly things; I ſhall aſcend in my progreſſe, if I ſhall daily profit in thy miniſtery; and I ſhall aſcend in effect, if I have my converſation where thou art, even in the heavens. And I truſt I ſhall eaſily obtaine this; for thou art aſcended to the Father, to be my Interceſſor. The high Prieſt, when he entred the Holy of Holyes, made an atonement for the people; thou art entred into the Sanctuary of bleſſed immortality, a Sanctuary not made with hands, but heaven it ſelfe: thou wilt therefore appear in the preſence of God for us. Thou art aſcended, not leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the earth thy humanity, which thou tookeſt from the earth, and didſt carry about thee on the earth, but haſt ſo exalted it, that thou haſt made it a partaker of heaven. Why therefore, O man, ſhouldeſt thou feare? why, O man, ſhouldeſt thou afflict thy ſelfe? Be ſecure fleſh and blood, you are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of heaven, and Gods Kingdome in Chriſt: if any deny you are in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10247:87"/> Chriſt, he denies alſo that Chriſt is in heaven; the fleſh and blood, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every of us, is in the man, Chriſt Ieſus. Therefore where my portion reignes, I beleeve I reigne; where my blood doth rule, I perceive my ſelfe to rule: where my fleſh is glorified, I know I am glorious. Thou wenteſt to prepare a place for mee, that I might be with thee in a moſt pleſant City; thou laydſt open the way, that I might come into thy moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſociety; Thou didſt firſt break through, that I might alſo enter into moſt ample felicity, in everlaſting health of body, in perfect purity of our ſoules, in all fullneſſe of glory, and divine pleaſure, into the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall familiarity of the Saints, to have kindred, hope, reſting place, grace, and dignity, in the heavens.</p>

That common expected time of gladneſſe of all the righteous is now come, the ſweet gueſt of the ſoule is come, the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table refreſhing, the reſt in our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the temper in heate, comfort in mourning, the waſhing of that which was foule, watering that which was partched with heate, healing that which is wounded, ſtraightning what was crooked, cheriſhing that which was cold, ordering what was gone aſtray.

They were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together with one accord; and indeed that ſpirit loves agreement, and doth bind faſter together mens peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minds; it drives away all brawles and contentions, and is it ſelfe driven away by brawles and contentions. They were gathered together in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; it loves a holy place, and where thy word is preached, there it grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abideth. This word is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit; nor thy word without the ſpirit; there was a ſound like a wind; the holy ſpirit is not ſtill, but its voyce is heard, hee is not dumbe,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10247:88"/> but ſpeaketh, and preacheth redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſinners, revelations to thoſe in miſery; comfort to thoſe that bee ſad; exaltation to thoſe that are opreſſed; deliverance to the captives; liberty to the bondmen; and rerſurrection to the dead. There was a ſudden and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſound from heaven; the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not the gift of men, but of the Almighty God; it brings not momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but things eternall, not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but heavenly things. Gods helpe is alſo (for the moſt part) ſudden and unlooked for; when wee deſpaire of all mens ayd, the power of the moſt High is ſent us, and cures us in a moſt fit time. The holy ſpirit is cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and makes them nimble, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in whom it operates; for the grace of the holy ſpirit is not acquainted with ſluggiſh endevours. The tongues appeared devided like fire; the tongue is the inſtrument of the holy ghoſt, whereby it prepares and enlargeth the ſpirituall Kingdome; and as the tongue doth diſtinguiſh taſtes, ſo doth the holy ſpirit ſhew us good from ill, and to diſcerne between ſpirits; it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beſtowes on us the gift of variety of languages, and gathers together in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10247:89"/> one the multitudes of men, diſperſed by reaſon of the difference of their tongues. The love of God is, laſtly, fiery, it enlightens the underſtandings drowned in darkneſſe, it warmes the ſoules by charity, makes them ſhine in good works, conſumes wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions; O moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fire, deſcende from heaven into us. We burne with the filthy brands of our luſts, that the earth ſeemes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Aetna of uncleane flames, than an habitation of men. For as the hill Aetna doth continually boyle with certaine inward fiery vapors, ſo doth that with the abhominable flames of fornications; by this meanes we kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the fire of wrath, the fire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the fire of the Lord, the fire of indignation, which went out from the Lord and conſumed <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu.</hi> How grievouſly doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet cry out, behold, all of you doe kindle his fire and adde fuell to the flames; enter yee into the light of your fire and the flames which yee have kindled. For after this manner, as the ſcripture mentioneth, doth all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ruſh into eternall damnation. For firſt they kindle the fire, then they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10247:89"/> put fuell to the flames; and finally, they enter into the flames which they have kindled. And firſt doe wee begin to kindle the eternall fire for our ſelves when firſt we begin to ſinne, and we adde fuell to the flames when we heap ſins upon ſins; We enter into the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fire, when we fulfill the remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſumme of all our miſchiefes, by the iniquity of our multiplyed offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: As our Saviour ſpake to the Rulers of the Jewes, <hi>Yee ſerpents yee genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vipers, fulfill yee the meaſure of your fathers.</hi> O heavenly Spirit, let plentifull ſhowres fall from heaven, and quench the accurſed flames of this fire, that I be not delivered into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable flames, which no water, no brooke, no river, no ſea can quench. Filth ſticks to me on all ſides; who will waſh it off? I am polluted with the dirt of my ſins; who ſhall make mee cleane?

Bleſſed be alwayes the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, one Diety, and coequall Majeſty. The Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, are three names, all of them one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, God the begetter, God the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, the Holy Spirit equall God, contained in them both; yet they are not three Gods, but one true God; ſo
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10247:91"/> the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Ghoſt Lord: there is proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Perſons, and unity in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; an equall Majeſty and Power, equal Beauty &amp; Honour, in all things; comprehending the Starres, the Seas, the Fields, nay the whole Creation; at whom wicked hell doth tremble, and whom the loweſt depths doe reverence. Let every voice and tongue now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe him worthy this praiſe, whom Sunne and Moone doe magnifie, and the Angelicall dignity doth adore; and let us all with ſtrained voyce, with muſicall ſongs and ſweet melody war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forth his praiſes. O let us now ſing together before the Throne of our God, that is exalted in the higheſt. O Trinity to be adored, O Unity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced! Thou true Eternity, by thee are we created; thou moſt perfect chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by thee are we redeemed; doe thou protect, ſave, deliver, ſet free, and cleanſe all people; we worſhip thee, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we ſing unto thee, to thee be praiſe and glory for ever and ever. For it is truly a worthy and a juſt thing, a right and a ſaving thing, that we ſhould at all times, and in all places give thanks unto thee, O Lord, holy Father, God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10247:91"/> Almighty, who with thy only begotten Son and the Holy Ghoſt are one God, attone Lord, not in the ſingularity of one Perſon, but in the ſubſtance of one Trinity: for that which wee beleeve from thy revelation concerning thy glory, this wee underſtand without difference of diſtinction, both of the Son and alſo of the Holy Ghoſt, that the propriety of Perſons, the unitie of Eſſence, and equality of Majeſtie may be adored in the confeſſion of a true and an eternall Deitie. One man is not ſo much as three men joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and two men are ſomething more than one; but in God it is not ſo, for the Father and Son together are not a greater Eſſence than the Father alone, or the Son alone, but thoſe three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons together are equall one to another. The conſideration of the word, One, extends farre, to the making evident of this ſingle Unity. There is an unitie which may bee called collective, as when many ſtones make up one heape of ſtones; there is alſo an unitie conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive, when many members make up one body, or many parts of any thing make up the whole thing it ſelfe. There is alſo an unity conjugative, whence
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:10247:92"/> it comes to paſſe that two by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age are now no more two, but one fleſh. And there is a native unity, whence by the ſoule and body one man is borne: There is a poteſtative unity, whereby a vertuous man is not inſtable or unlike himſelfe, but doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes endevour to bee found like to himſelfe. It is a conſentaneous unitie, when by charity many men have one heart and one ſoule. There is a votive unitie, when the ſoule adhering to God in all its deſires, becomes one ſpirit. There is a dignitative unitie, whereby our corrupt fleſh is by God the Word, aſſumed into one Perſon. But what are all theſe things to that moſt high, and as I may ſo ſay, that onely unitie where conſubſtantiality maketh the unity? If thou liken any of the former unities to this unity, it will be after a ſort alike; but if you compare it with it, it will bee nothing: therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all things which are rightly ſaid to be one, the unity of the Trinity, wherein three Perſons are one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, doth hold the preheminence; each particular Perſon is in each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſon; all the Perſons conjoyned are in each particular Perſon, and each
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10247:92"/> diſtinct Perſon, in all the Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; all are in all, and all is but one, none of theſe precedes another in eternitie, or exceeds another in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or excells another in power; that which is there ſaid to be great, is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe great, than as it is truly ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; becauſe there greatneſſe is truth it ſelfe, and truth is Eſſence; therefore that is not greater which is not truer, but one Perſon is not truer than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, or two of them than any one, or all three together than all three ſeparated each from other; therefore one hath no more truth than another, or two than any one, or all together than each aſunder: So then alſo the Trinitie it ſelfe is not any thing greater than every diſtinct Perſon in it, but is equally great with them. Theſe are wonderfull things, and ſet farre above the reach of any creature; therefore mans underſtanding doth very hardly aſſent to theſe myſteries which are ſet ſo farre from our view, and the minde eaſily begins to wander after ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if wee have not before us a more ſublime doctrine which may recall our phanſies into the right bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet for us by God himſelfe. That
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10247:93"/> doctrine is divine; No man can take an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by the hand if he want his owne; we cannot ſee the Sunne without the Sunne, nor can any conceive divine things without divine aſſiſtance, nor can we know God without God. Be preſent therefore thou true Light, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God and Father; bee preſent thou Light of lights, thou Word and Son of God, God Almighty; be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent holy Spirit, thou concord of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, God Almighty; bee preſent one omnipotent God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; we confeſſe in thee, by thee, and of thee; we confeſſe thou art one in Subſtance, three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt: O bleſſed Trinity, God, Lord, Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Charity, Grace, Fellowſhip, Beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Begotten, Regenerating, true Light, true Light of light, illumination, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible viſibly, viſible inviſibly, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and watering ſtreames; from whom, by whom, and in whom are all things; he that lives from himſelfe and is Life it ſelfe, he that receives life from him that lives, and he that gives life to thoſe that live; a true Father, the Son of truth, the Spirit of truth, one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, one Vertue, one Goodneſſe, God,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10247:93"/> above whom is nothing, and out of whom is nothing, and without whom is nothing. God, under whom is all, in whom is all, and with whom is all; we call upon thee, wee adore thee, wee praiſe thee; encreaſe our faith, ſtirre up our hope, and infuſe us with charitie, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>WHy art thou afflicted, O my ſoule, if reaſon be tormoiled, and doth groane and cry out, being plunged in a bottomleſſe gulfe? A thing is not therefore falſe becauſe I cannot conceive or underſtand it: reaſon is not the meaſure of things, but it is bound to fit it ſelfe to things: reaſon is ſtreight, and why then doſt thou marvell if it cannot comprehend the vaſtneſſe of heavenly things? by how much more ſimple our faith is, ſo much is our life more agreeable to it, although we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute of, neither doe underſtand all things. By ſo much more noble and more renowned ſhall the citizens of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10247:94"/> the Church, be (hereafter) eſteemed of God, becauſe forſaking all, they ſhewed themſelves willing to become only moſt deare unto him; it is a ſhort way for religious and ſimple minds, both to caſt away errour and to ſearch out the truth. For if we returne to the fountaine and head of divine tradition, the errour of man vaniſheth away; and the reaſon of the heavenly Sacraments being underſtood, what ever before lay hid under the miſt and cloud of obſcure darkneſſe, is made apparant by the light of truth; if the waters of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, which uſed to flow plentifully, be ſuddenly dried up, doe we not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe to the ſpring-head, that there we may diſcover the reaſon that it failes? whether the pipes grow dry from the head, or running full and currantly from thence, they bee not ſtopped in their middle courſe? but if we finde it is by reaſon that the pipes it flowes in, be either ſtopped or broken, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot runne conſtantly, and flow as it uſed to doe; when we have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſodered the pipes, the waters being collected, are brought in the ſame plenty and conſtancie for the uſe and drinking of the Citizens, as they doe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10247:94"/> flow from the fountaine. Wee muſt even doe thus according to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that is, if truth ſhall ſtagger or reele in any thing, let us returne to the originall of it, namely, our Saviour, his Goſpell, and the Apoſtolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thence let us ground the reaſon of our actions, whence the order and originall of it firſt aroſe. Whilſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make lyes of probabilities, they fruſtrate the truth by ſubtilties; and this is done, becauſe they have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the originall of truth; nor doe they ſeeke to the head, nor obſerve the doctrine of their heavenly Maſter; which whoſoever conſiders and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, he hath no need of arguments and long diſcourſes. The triall of our faith is eaſie by the compendiouſneſſe of truth; I would have no man diſpute how God the Father begate the Son; nor doe thou too curiouſly involve thy ſelfe within the ſecret of this depth, leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, whilſt thou too obſtinately ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt after the brightneſſe of this in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible light, thou be deprived of that little ſight which by Gods gift is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto mortall creatures: Or if thou thinkeſt thou oughteſt to wade ſo farre in this kind as thou art able: Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10247:95"/> thou with things which concerne our ſelves, which if thou wilt (conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently) wade thorow, then prepare thy ſelfe to paſſe from earthly things to heavenly things, from viſible things to inviſible things. Firſt unfold and declare if thou canſt, how the minde that is in thee, begets a word; and what is the ſpirit of memory that is in it; how theſe things that are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in things and actions, are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding but one nature and ſubſtance; and though they proceed from the minde, yet are never ſeparated from it. But theſe things, although wee have them in us, in the very ſubſtance of our ſoule, yet they ſeeme to be ſo much the more hidden unto us, by how much they are more inviſible to the eyes of the body. Let us enquire of things more open; how doth a fountaine of it ſelfe beget a river? and by what ſpirit are the ſwift ſtreames thereof moved? and though the fountaine and ſtreames be but the ſame, one inſeparable thing, yet cannot the fountaine be either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to bee or be called the river, nor the river the fountaine, yet he that ſees the ſtreames, ſees the fountaine. Firſt exerciſe thy ſelfe, thou ſuperſtitious, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10247:95"/> impertinently laborious, and thou ſoule that toyleſt after nullities in the unfolding of theſe things, and diſcuſſe, if thou canſt, what we hold in our hands: and then we will proceed to things higher than theſe: nor thinke I perſwade thee in an inſtant to aſcend from earth above the heavens, but firſt if it pleaſe you, I will bring you to that firmament which is apparant to our view, and there if thou canſt unfold the nature of this viſible light, how that heavenly fire begets from it ſelfe the ſhining light, how it begets vapors, and which being three in diſtinctneſſe of things, are yet but one in ſubſtance; although thou couldeſt finde out all this, know yet, that the myſtery of the heavenly generation, is by ſo much more different and higher than theſe things, by how much the Creator is more powerfull than the creatures, and the workman more excellent than the worke he makes; by how much he who is from all eternity, is more noble than that that tooke its originall from nothing. God is therefore to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the Father of his onely Son our Lord, and it is not to be enquired how. For a ſervant ought not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10247:96"/> of his maſters nativity. He wants nothing, O man, who is confirmed by the doctrine of both Teſtaments. Both of them are theſe two ſwords, of which the eternall Doctor ſaid, <hi>It is enough.</hi> I wiſh againe and againe, my long-ſuffering God, that I might learne and know him; but if I know not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, nor can meaſure the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor am able ſufficiently to conſider what manner of thing my ſoule is, which rules over my body; if I know not the reaſon why it ſhould take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the body which perſecuteth it; if I be ignorant who hath graven this law of my members, that the fleſh ſhould oppreſſe the ſpirit in ſo violent a command, and that the better and more worthy part of nature ſhould yeeld to the more ignoble: I ought to beare patiently, if I underſtand not the Creator of the Univerſe, who muſt even in the ſmalleſt parcels of his works, profeſſe mine owne blindneſſe. Let me not then proceed farther in other things, than my ſmall capacity wil beare, not curiouſly pry into thoſe things which are ſo high above me. I will ſay with reaſon and conſtancie, I know not his ſecrets, and I am ignorant of his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10247:96"/> divine councell; the oracle of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly word is enough for me to try all cauſes. God ſayes he ſees all things, governes all things, judges all things. If thou wilt know what thou art to hold, thou haſt the holy Scripture; it is perfect reaſon to hold what thou haſt read. But I will not ſuffer my ſelfe to aske for what cauſe God doth theſe things in ſuch a manner; I am a man, I underſtand not the ſecrets of God, I dare not ſearch after them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I even feare to meddle with them: becauſe even this is a kinde of ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious raſhneſſe, to deſire to know more than is permitted unto thee. Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thee that God doth teſtifie, that himſelfe doth act, and diſpoſe of all things: leaving therefore theſe things, let us rather ſeeke (like good merchants) to gaine the inheritance of heaven, and thoſe things that may profit our ſoules: let us learne to get goods which will continue with us; let us firſt ſeeke to have Gods ſeale ſtamped upon us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the day of judgement, when God ſhal make that ſeparation, &amp; when all the nations of the whole earth, the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when the ſhepherd ſhall call
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10247:97"/> his flocke, whoſoever have beene ſealed, ſhall know their ſhepherd, and the ſhepherd ſhall know thoſe he hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſhall gather them together out of all nations. Every man naturally deſireth knowledge; but what doth knowledge profit without the feare of God? certainly an humble rudeneſſe is better, that is employed in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than a proud Prelate or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who neglects himſelfe, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes contemplating upon God, or the motion of the heavens. How many are there, who in this life, by many curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiries, have endevoured to know God, who ſhall never ſee his face? how many in this life doe labour to meaſure the heavens, and to finde out all things belonging to them, that ſhall never enter into them? He that doth well know himſelfe, thinks meanly of himſelfe, and is not delighted in the praiſes of men. If I did know all things in the world, and were not in charity, what would this knowledge profit me in the preſence of God, who then will judge acccording to my works? I will therefore (at length) reſt from the too much deſire of knowledge, becauſe the more I know, the more grievouſly will
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10247:97"/> the moſt high God judge me, except I live the more holily. Give mee (moſt bleſſed and moſt wiſe God) the higheſt and moſt profitable knowledge, that I may know thee, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, with moderation, and may inwardly know my ſelfe to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and of no account; that I may attribute nothing to my ſelfe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have a good opinion of others. This is great wiſdome and ſome ſort of perfection; Though I ſee another ſinne openly and even to commit ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinnes; let me not think my ſelfe better, becauſe I know not how long I may continue in goodneſſe; we are all undoubtedly fraile; but let me judge none frailer than my ſelfe, that I may obtaine true ſtrength in goodneſſe.</p>

O God my God, thou ſoughteſt me when I knew not of thee; thou gaveſt unto me, when I asked not of thee; thou openedſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me when I did not knocke; for when I was yet a bawling infant, in my bepiſſed clouts; when I yet ſavoured ill of my mothers coutch; when I was putrified, as well with mine owne, as with the naturall and ſpirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of my parents; yet thou, not diſheartned with all this, didſt take me up, cheriſh and purge me that was thus conceived, and chafed in my ſins. Thou leddeſt me to the pure waters, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters; to the divine oracle, to the lavacre, in the word of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and renovation; thou broughteſt me, O God my God, to baptiſme, the firſt gate to be entred to the kingdome of heaven; into the armes, and to the kiſſes of my Saviour, by which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10247:103"/> into his heavenly habitation, and enroles us into the number of Gods elect, and citizens of heaven, and makes us members of his body, which being one with the head, become partakers of the heavenly treaſures. O God my God, thou haſt promiſed this by thy Prophet, Ye ſhall draw waters with joy out of the wholſome fountaines: And, I will powre out my waters upon the thirſty, and my ſtreames upon the dry ground. I will powre out my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thy poſterity, and they ſhall grow amongſt the graſſe like willowes, by the rivers of waters. And againe, they ſhall bring their ſonnes in their armes, and carry their daughters upon their ſhoulders. And I, O moſt mercifull Lord, was brought, carried, ſprinkled, and waſhed amongſt them, and did mount up unto thee, as it were upon the wings of an Eagle. I laid aſide the decrepit age of my ſinnes, and put on the vigorous youth of grace; this did this heavenly Sacrament worke in me. I began to be a true Eagle, who by thy grace doe ſoare to heaven, and doe loath all earthly things. As often as I behold earthly water, I ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10247:103"/> this divine water, which hath wrough ſo many and ſo great things in us. The naturall water doth waſh and take away ſpots, doth quench fire, cooles and allayes the heat of thirſt, incorporates many and ſundry things into one body; it aſcends as high in heighth, as it doth deſcend below in depth. The heavenly water of Baptiſme waſhes away the leproſie of ſinne, and wipes away our iniquities, and makes us whiter than ſnow. Our ſins in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are like ſcarlet, yet are they white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as white as ſnow; they are red like crimſon, yet they grow white as wooll. The water of Baptiſme, by a divine and admirable way and means, doth quench the fire of our fleſhly deſires. How pleaſing is it to us, ſo ſoone as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit ſlides into us in this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for us to want theſe trifling ſweets? The true and chiefeſt ſweetneſſe doth caſt out thoſe other, which elſe wee would feare to loſe; it caſteth them out, and there enters (in their ſtead) the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and heavenly pleaſure, which is ſweeter than all other pleaſure, yet not to fleſh and blood; is brighter than any other light, yet more hidden than any ſecret; higher than any other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10247:104"/> but not to men that are high in their owne conceits: It quencheth alſo the flames of hell fire, thoſe devilliſh brands of hell, which no helpe of man can put out. The divine water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſets an end to the various and troubleſome deſires of mans heart, and makes us onely reſt upon God. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine water of Baptiſme makes one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the nations, of the Iſraelites and of the Heathen, that did differ ſo exceedingly in moſt things, that they might become one body, and one ſoule, one hope of calling, till at length they may be made perfect in one. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine water of Baptiſme is given us from heaven above, from the Father of lights, and it flowing from the fountaine that ſprings to eternall life, doth not onely draw our hearts to their owne origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, but doth wholly lead us to that moſt bleſſed fountain. Farewell World, avoid Satan, be gone each worldly thing, for I call to minde theſe words that my Godfather holding me in his armes, pronounced for me, I renounce thee Satan, and thy pompe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: with theſe words am I received into Gods covenant, and enrolled in the number of Chriſts ſouldiers. What
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10247:104"/> ever thou ſhalt ſay, O Serpent, I will preſently reply; what ever thou ſhalt ſpeake, I will not hearken unto thee, Then, that thou catch me not by other meanes, I have renounced alſo thy pompe, and thy worſhip and thy meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers. I was preſt for the warre of the living God, when I anſwered to the words in the Sacrament. Whatſoever earthly things are received in this world, and ſhall here remaine in this world, are to be deſpiſed, as much as the world it ſelfe is to be contemned, the pomps and delights whereof I did then renounce, when in my better paſſage I went unto my Lord. In Baptiſme I was cloathed in white, that I might be taught (moſt devoutly) to rely upon Chriſts innocency, and to be willing to lead my life ſincerely and purely. I confeſſe (indeed) my God, that I have beene ſometime forgetfull of my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with thee, that I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the hoaſte of righteouſneſſe, and have runne away to thy enemy, and have moſt grievouſly offended thee my Captaine, by my tranſgreſſions and treaſons, that I have beene worthy thy moſt ſevere puniſhment: but I returne to thee, I fall before thee, and beſeech

            <p>IT is an eaſie thing for one to call himſelfe a Chriſtian, but a hard thing to performe the part of a Chriſtian. He that deſires to fulfill the meaſure of that name, let him marke diligently theſe things that follow. Acknowledge, O man, thine owne baſeneſſe; conſider how wretched, and of how little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thou art, thou haſt nothing from thy ſelfe, but all things from God: he gave thee all things for thy uſe, to whom thou muſt repay them, yea, and even thy life it ſelfe, at what moment ſoever he ſhall require them; and thou muſt depart as naked from hence, as thou cameſt naked into this world and although all the world, with it: inhabitants, doe keepe thee companys
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10247:105"/> yet they can profit thee nothing; for all things are fleeting, brittle, tranſitory, and nothing can free thee from death; give not thy ſelfe therefore over to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, but feare God, and examine exactly what may be truly profitable for thee. Doe good to the poore with all thy power, that thou mayeſt gather for thy ſelfe a treaſure in heaven. Doe all that God bids thee, for thou art bound to doe good with thy will and ſpirit: but he that knowes to doe well, and doth it not, he is guilty of ſinne; but he that doth good, doth it not from himſelfe, but for that cauſe that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him of God, and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God. Love not (O man) the world, or the things of the world, as the luſts of the fleſh, the deſires of the eyes, and the pride of life but feare God, and meditate with thy ſelfe of heavenly things: ſtrive to fulfill Gods will in all vertuouſneſſe; ſhun worldly, &amp; minds ſet upon the earth, that thou be not defiled with other mens ſins; ſeeke Gods kingdome, and ſo uſe the mirth is permitted to thee, that thou mayeſt alwayes tremble, ſtand in awe, and ſhew thy ſelfe thankfull, that thou fall into no ſecret ſin, or be delighted with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10247:106"/> the tree of good and evill, and with the ſight of a momentany pleaſure thou remove (like <hi>Eve</hi>) the law of God out of thine eyes and heart, which ſhould be, nevertheleſſe, the ſumme and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pitch of all thy delights. It ſhould be thy delight night and day, that it may be to thee the right way, the truth, and the life, if thou wilt lead a a living life, conducting to life eternall, not to everlaſting death. Next, O man, keepe theſe three things, faith, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtedfaſtneſſe of hope. What ever thou doſt, ſee thou doe it in faith, in ſimplicity of heart, in confidence of the fatherly will of God, and give God thanks, to whom they are due, and his bleſſings ſhall be alwayes thy hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid: let charity ſpring from the ground of thy heart, nor be carefull to give thy ſelfe content, but labour with feare and humility to pleaſe God. Be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unto men in truth, mercy, and juſtice, without flattery for that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity. Charity bids us look to the things that concerne God &amp; our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not only thoſe things w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concern my ſelfe. Let thy hope be without feare and doubting; let him that deſires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, heavenly, and eternall things, reſt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10247:106"/> upon the wil of God, and not upon ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, fraile and brittle things. No man ſhall make thee loſe thy hold of that hope which thou haſt placed upon God: thou mayeſt hope upon him, even in the pangs of death, for he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Never let humility ſlip out of thy mind; for he preſerveth thy life by ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, ſtrengthens it by patience, and feeds it by truth. Commit all thy waies unto God, and hee ſhall bring it to paſſe; he knowes what is for thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and what not. Thinkeſt thou that he knowes not thy condition? behold God ſees and knowes all things, and nothing is hid from his eyes. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards alſo the poore and contrite ſpirit, and him that trembleth at his Word. Search not therefore after high things; when thou art commended, feare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art an unprofitable ſervant, and canſt doe nothing except thou be aſſiſted by the power, favour, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Thinke not better of thy ſelfe than of thy neighbour, for thou art a man of nought; remember God is only to be honoured, and thou ſhalt be the greater, if thou caſt down thy ſelfe. Be alwayes ruminating of theſe things firſt, let no vain, idle, ſcurrilous words
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10247:107"/> break from thy lips, but godly, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, profitable, which tend to life, and lead not to death; therefore bridle thy tongue, and reſtraine it, for it can kill, and give life. Secondly, to keepe thy ſoule and conſcience free from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, exclude thou malice and impious thoughts, and never ſhun the light: O thrice happie and more is hee whoſe heart condemnes him not. Thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeſt to God (O man) walke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with God; remove from thee darkneſſe, lyes, and injuſtice, for he is a Judge, and a revenger of ſuch things. Trie and prove thy ſelfe in all things, that thou mayſt know what vice ſticks to thee, what vertue thou wanteſt, that thou mayſt ſhake off that, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe this; for thou canſt never bee ſo perfect, that ſomething will not ſtill be wanting. Whatſoever thou doſt, thou doſt it by Gods indulgence and helpe, if it be acceptable to him; for of thy ſelfe thou art very nothing, and by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit canſt thou onely proceed in goodneſſe; ſtay not therefore or hinder the operations thereof; work out thy ſalvation with feare and trembling, in continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, humility, and ſimplicitie of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10247:107"/> heart, and think that thou art neither worthy of the bleſſings of this life, or of that which is to come. Laſtly, pray without ceaſing in all thy labours, pray reverently, devoutly and humbly with faith in all thy wayes, with a moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deſire of thy neighbours ſalvation. Thou muſt pray in thy chamber, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe, in moſt humble devotion, in faſtings, in teares, in anguiſh, in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, in contrition upon thy knees night and day, with a full hope, and not doubting, according to the will of God, for all the true profeſſors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith; ſtudy in all things to pleaſe God and not men; whoſoever honours God, God will alſo honour him; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever contemnes God, God ſhall alſo contemne him. Grant me thy grace, moſt mercifull God, that it may bee with me, that it may labour with me, and may continue with me even unto the end. Grant I may (alwayes) will and deſire that which is moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto thee, and moſt dearly pleaſeth thee; let thy will be my will, and let my will alwayes follow thine, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree beſt with it; let me will, and will the ſame thing that thou doſt; and grant I may not have power otherwiſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10247:108"/> to will, or not to will them as thou doſt. O my God, thou unſpeakable ſweetneſſe, turne all carnal comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bitterneſſe unto me, which doe draw me from the love of things eternall, and evilly allure mee under colour of ſome preſent delectable good. Let not fleſh and blood, O my God, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me; let not the world and its ſhort glory deceive me; let not the devill and his ſubtilty ſupplant mee. Give mee ſtrength to reſiſt, patience to endure, conſtancie to performe; give mee in ſtead of all the comforts of the world, the moſt ſweet unction of thy Spirit, and infuſe into mee the love of thy Name, in ſtead of carnall love. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme me, my God, by the grace of thy holy Spirit; give mee power to bee ſtrengthned in the inward man, and to emptie my heart of all unprofitable care and vexation, nor to be diſtracted with the various deſires of any thing, whether it be vile or precious, but that I looke upon all things as if they paſſed but by me, and that I did alſo paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as they doe; becauſe nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun is of any continuance, but all things are vanity and vexation of ſpirit.

And we alſo are anointed Chriſtians, when we are ſeparate from the ungodlineſſe of worldly men, and are made holy by the myſtery of the Spirit. We were anointed, when, as Chriſt did receive the gifts of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit without meaſure, we received them with meaſure. We are anointed, when we are exalted to propheticall, prieſtly, and kingly dignity; and this is that which the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am in the midſt of Iſrael, and that I am Iehovah, your God, and that none elſe is; nor ſhall my people be aſhamed for ever: And it ſhall come to paſſe afterward, that I will powre out my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſonnes, and your daughters ſhall propheſie, your old men ſhall dreame dreames, and your young menſh ll ſee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> which hee declareth by his moſt deare diſciple. Jeſus Chriſt is that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſe, that firſt borne from the dead, and that Prince of the kings of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10247:111"/> the earth, who hath loved us, and hath waſhed us from our ſinnes by his blood; who hath made us kings and prieſts to God his Father. You are a choſen ſtocke, a royall prieſthood, a ſanctified people, a nation whom God challengeth for his owne. O name, not above every name, yet a divine, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and anhonourable name; here is fulfilled that which the Prophet ſaid; <hi>A new name ſhall be given thee, which the mouth of the Lord ſhall beſtow on thee.</hi> We have changed our accurſed name, becauſe God hath given us a new name. Take heed to your ſelves, take heed who ever you be, that you deſpiſe none of the faithfull, that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme or reproach them not, though he ſeeme moſt miſerable, moſt abject; and moſt afflicted: for let his miſery or affliction be as great as may be, yet is he the Almighty Gods Anointed, the Prophet of the moſt holy, the Prieſt of the moſt High; yea, he is himſelfe a king of moſt great Majeſty. Yee are Prophets, O Chriſtians, therefore let the Word of God dwell plentifully in you, with all wiſdome, teaching and admoniſhing one another, with pſalms and hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10247:112"/> unto the Lord with grace in your hearts. Ye are Prieſts, ye Chriſtians, therefore I beſeech you, my brethren, by the mercies of God, that you give up your bodies a living and a holy ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and acceptable to God, by your reaſonable ſervice of him, and be not faſhioned like this world, but be yee changed through the renewing of your mindes, that ye may diſcerne what is: the good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. Ye are Kings, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, be not therefore ſervants of ſin, or be ſubject to the boyling affections of the fleſh, but mortifie your ſinnes, tame your luſts, nor proſtitute your dignity to a moſt baſe and impure ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. Extoll your Chriſt, becauſe all your eminencie, all your worth, all your grace, and all your glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from him. As the rivers do flow from the ſea, and flow back againe into the ſame; ſo let your eminency, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, grace, and glory, be directed, diſpoſed of, and referred to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and giver thereof. Call upon Chriſt, O ye Chriſtians, becauſe though you be anointed, yet may that oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be overwhelmed, defiled, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off by the filth of your ſinnes, and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10247:112"/> the durt of your corruptions; ye carry heavenly gifts in brittle veſſels, pray that they be not broken, and your graces ſpilt; pray that no wind may extinguiſh your flame, that your oyle faile you not, and yee be left in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with the fooliſh virgins. Love your Chriſt, yee Chriſtians, becauſe he is anointed, that you might be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe he is a King that hath all the inhabitants of the earth for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; becauſe he is a Prieſt, that hath expiated all the ſinnes of the whole world; becauſe he is a Prophet that doth inſtruct all the ignorant, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, and teacheth them the right way to life. Love Chriſt, you Chriſtians, becauſe the moſt apparant manifeſtation of a thankfull mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in words, but works; not in promiſes, but in obedience. But to the end you may more fully conſider your dignity, the birth of a Chriſtian is to be weighed: God is his Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Church is his mother upon the earth. The Word of God to be heard and ſeene, is the ſeed; that is the Word preached, this is the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Yee are borne againe, not of corruptible ſeed, but incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10247:113"/> by the Word of God that lives and abideth for evermore. The Father of lights hath begotten you by the Word of his truth. The Churches are the wombe where the ſeed of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Word is ſcattered, and in which the eternall Father, and our mother the Church doe meet together. The heart of man is the matter of this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the privation, is the mortification of the old <hi>Adam;</hi> the forme, is the vivification it ſelfe, whence doth ariſe the aſſent of the underſtanding, and confidence of the will, that the ſonne of wrath may become the ſonne of grace, the blinde may ſee, the deafe may heare, the dumbe may ſpeake, the lame walke, the leaper be cleanſed, and life may be reſtored to the dead. The time of this formation is when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth more and more profit in knowledge of the underſtanding and holineſſe in the heart; the carrying in the wombe is when in our whole life, by meanes of the veſſels of the wombe, and navell, that is, by the miniſters of the Word, he attracteth to himſelfe the milke of ſaving knowledge, from the two breaſts of the Church, the Law and the Goſpell; and as an Embrion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10247:113"/> lives in the wombe, ſo he lives in the Word. Hee is a brute creature, and more ſilly than a beaſt, that doth not admire, that a childe in the wombe ſhould be preſerved alive in ſo darke a priſon, in ſo uncleane ſtreights, among ſo many filths, corruptions, excrements, wrapped in filmes, and crowded by the bowels: but it is farre more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that any Chriſtian ſhould be ſupported amidſt ſo many griefes, paines, torments, ſnares, and calamities. For about the wombe wherein we are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the World cries, I will ſlay him; the Fleſh cries, I will infect him; the Devill cries, I will deceive him. Wee muſt there lie hid, where there is much malice, where is little wiſdome, where all things are viſcous and ſlimie, all things hid in darkneſſe, and beſet with ſnares, where the ſoules are in danger, the bodies are afflicted, where all things are vanity and vexation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and yet for all this we live and are preſerved; we live and are not killed; we are nouriſhed, and not in want; we are carried in the wombe, and are not abortive; we are ſuſtained, and are in want of nothing. The Embrion in the mothers wombe lives a hidden
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:10247:114"/> life; he lives (indeed) in the world, but is not ſeene with the eyes of any; he ſends forth his breath, but ſcarce draws any in: we alſo, Embrions of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, lead a hidden life. For though we live in the kingdome of heaven, yet our glory and deſireable life doth not as yet make any great ſhew; we yet behold not the light of eternall bleſſedneſſe; we yet draw not the aire of the region of Paradiſe; we yet eat not the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Manna; we yet drinke not of the heavenly liquour, but have (as it were) but a light taſte of al theſe things; and we have ſcarce any ſenſible breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe things. But the houre is at hand, and the time will come, that it ſhall be made manifeſt what we ſhall be, wherein we ſhall beginne and never end; this glorious light, this life, not of hope, but of the things hoped for, even the life of viſion. We ſhal begin this life when we die, for then begin we to be borne to the true light, when we firſt put off our mortality. For the true birth day of Chriſtians, is their day of death. In death they do begin to live, through death they enter into life: as the infant lies ſighing at the port of the wombe, expecting his paſſage; and though he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10247:114"/> be even at deaths threſhold, yet is he conveyed into the haven of life. O li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving death of Chriſtians! O Chriſtian, ſonne of God, brother of Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of the Angels, Lord of the world, partaker of the divine nature! O Chriſtian, exalted above ſin and the law, and placed above death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan! O Jeſu my Lord! O Chriſt my Captaine! thy name be glorified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt given me a bleſſed name, denominated from thine owne name. Let thy praiſe be daily borne in my mouth, becauſe thou art daily born in my heart, that I may be born againe in thee, and may live to thee, and with thee. For no man is rightly called a Chriſtian, that is not conformed (as much as may be) to Chriſt in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and he beares this name in vaine, that doth not at all imitate Chriſt. For what doth it profit thee to be called what thou art not, and to uſurpe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans name? If any take pleaſure to be a Chriſtian, let him carry about him what belongeth to a Chriſtian, and then he may worthily take upon him the name of a Chriſtian; but he doth thoſe things which belong to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, who ſhewes mercy to all; that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:10247:115"/> is not moved by any wrong done to him; that is as ſenſible of anothers griefe, as of his owne; that makes not the poore ſtrangers at his table; that is not magnified amongſt men, that hee may be gloried before God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: who contemnes earthly things, that he may obtaine heavenly things; that doth not ſuffer the poore to be here oppreſſed; who helpeth thoſe that are in diſtreſſe; who is moved to weepe by other mens tears; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, for who is weake, ſaith he, and I am not weake? Grant unto me, O Chriſt, moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, that am the leaſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of all Chriſtians, that I may doe theſe things with all my power, and may perſevere in the deſire thereof, and that I may not halt, ſlip, or utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall off: for not the beginning, but the ending well is required in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; let that therefore be moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto me, O my Saviour. Amen.</p>

            <p>MAns life is a middle life, between the life of Angels, and the life of ſinners; if a man live after the fleſh, he is compared to the beaſts; if he live after the Spirit, he is made a compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Angels. Now that thou maiſt walke in the ſtraiteſt path, thou muſt conſider of thy thoughts, examine thy words, and weigh thy actions. As touching thy thoughts, give no time or place to ſinnes, but as ſoone as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the blade, before they can take root, plucke them up. Breake (in time) the Baſilisks egges, that none of them prove a ſerpent; daſh the Babiloniſh brats againſt the ſtones, while they be young. Fall not often into the ſame ſin, but abridge the cuſtome of ſinning, and ſin not without doubt, as if thou neither feareſt God nor man. Propoſe not to thy ſelfe thoſe things in thy thoughts, which are either unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or impoſſible. Be not wiſe too high. Thinke the world, and worldy things,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10247:116"/> to be but vaine, that thou doe not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them. Be alwayes mindfull of death, that thou feare it not too much when it comes unto thee: call to minde the laſt judgement, that thou maiſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare there with an undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: remember hell to avoid it, and bleſſednes, that thou maiſt enter into it. Learn (forthwith) therforemore &amp; more to know thine owne miſery, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from unbeleefe and the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods holy Commandements. Renounce therefore unbeleefe, and ſtrive to keepe all his precepts. Knock at the gate of the mercies of heaven, by the merit of Chriſt, and ſo humble thy ſelfe, as if thou wert to obtaine thoſe mercies, without his merits. What is the moſt abject creature in the world? let it not trouble thee to anſwer thy ſelfe, It is I, by reaſon of my ſinnes. And againe, if it be demanded of thee, what is the moſt pretious treaſure upon the earth? let it not trouble thee to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with thy ſelfe, the blood and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by which I am cleanſed from my ſinnes, and have ſalvation purchaſed for me. Above all, abhorre to ſinne willingly, and with a deliberate reſolution; for to have true
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10247:116"/> faith, and to ſinne voluntarily, can no more agree together, than fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the lambe and the wolfe. Be a true, faithfull, and ſincere ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, not onely in the publick aſſemblies, where Gods word is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Sacraments adminiſtred: but in the reſt of thy life, by flying evill, and doing of good. But if by reaſon of the infirmity of thy fleſh thou haſt committed any ſinne, loath it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and deſtroy it by ſpeedy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance. Pray onely unto God; whilſt thy conſcience reſts in prayer to him, ſinne withers, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſweet to thee beſides vertue and goodneſſe. Catch not too much at po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applauſe, which is very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and though thou think thy merits have deſerved to be taken notice of by thoſe that paſſe by thee, and that thou oughteſt to be reſpected of the good; yet uſe it moderately and diſcreetly, that it doe thee not more hurt, than ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and contempt. He is truly wiſe, that neither too greedily hunts after the peoples favour, nor too much deſpiſes it. Seeke, eſpecially, for a quiet minde, and be content with thy preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It is no harmfull thing, that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10247:117"/> ſome evil is mixed with the good things of this life, that God beſtowes upon us; God deales gently with thee, as with his Son, therefore deſpaire not; God doth alſo chaſten thee, be not thou impatient, lay hold on the golden meane, ſearch for things neceſſary, but not for ſuperfluities, and alwayes have an eye to Gods will, that thine owne will doe not oppreſſe thee; he is happie that can lie hid in this life, and is known to none but God and himſelfe. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man was wont to ſay, As often as I have been amongſt men, I ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the leſſe man from them. It is an eaſier thing to lye hid at home, than to keepe himſelfe well abroad; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that intends to obtain inward and ſpirituall gifts, he muſt with Jeſus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the throng; no man can ſafely be ſeene, but he that is willingly concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: the better ſort of men, in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of others, have often been in great hazard, by reaſon of their too much confidence. Thence is it, that it is more profitable to many, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be void of temptations, but to be often aſſaulted that they be not too ſecure, that they be not puffed up with pride, nor that they too licentiouſly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10247:117"/> leane to exteriour delights. O what a good conſcience would hee alwayes poſſeſſe, that would never ſeeke after tranſitory mirth, nor buſie himſelfe with the world! O how would hee prune off all vaine care, and only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of ſaving and divine things, and place all his hope in God, and what peace and quiet would he enjoy! Let the want of nothing, but of Gods grace, much trouble thee; deſire Gods grace, and thou ſhalt obtaine it, and let not the ſcarcity of outward things too much afflict thee. If Satan reproach thee with thy wants, conſider with thy ſelfe what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>We brought nothing into this world, and we know that we can carry nothing away from thence:</hi> and therefore let us be content with our food and cloathing; but thoſe that will bee rich, fall into temptations, and ſnares, and many fooliſh luſts, which afflict and drowne the ſons of men in ruine and deſtruction: Pray with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jakeh, I have deſired two things of thee, O God, deny them not unto me as long as I live; remove farre from me vanity and lyes; give me neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty nor riches, let me be nouriſhed with the meat of mine owne table, leſt being
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10247:118"/> over full, I lye againſt thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or being poore, I ſhould ſteale, and ſo abuſe the Name of my God.</hi> Bee grieved more for Gods diſhonour than thine owne; if thou ſuffereſt wrong, beare it patiently, and thou ſhalt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; yet, thou mayeſt ſay, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is ſtained, ſhall I endure it? Why not? ſuffer, and thy reputation will be ſoone repaired: he that ſhall at length, even in the laſt day, reſtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee thy putrified body, ſhall reſtore to thee thy credit; if thou be angry and enraged, and teare thy ſelfe, what ſhall all theſe turmoiles profit thee? Nothing is more pleaſing to thy enemie, than to ſee thee by thy rage to be in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Rather pray for thine enemies, that they be fellow-heires with thee of eternall life, and fellow-chaunters of thy Fathers praiſes in his heavenly Kingdome. The more others extoll thee, the more doe thou humble thy ſelfe in thine owne eyes, nor pleaſe thy ſelfe with ſuch vanities. They that eſteeme lightly of earthly things, are magnified and extolled by the Angels of heaven: proceed ſincerely, rightly, and innocently in every of thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor too earneſtly take care for the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10247:118"/> things thou haſt not. Think no ſin little, for there is none ſo light, (if any may bee ſaid light) but it may bring upon thee great plagues &amp; everlaſting death; therefore, deplore thy leaſt ſinnes, and pray without ceaſing for the bettering of thy life. Think how ſhort thy life is; if any ſeriouſly conſider what ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to us, he ſhall ſee they vaniſh from us like birds in the aire, and wee alſo by our perpetuall motion are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried beyond thoſe tranſitory things; but that which is worſt, no remedy can be found againſt this, for theſe things fall out thus by the law of Nature; for the things of this life are a dreame, a ſmoake and impoſtures; this is our life, O men that lead a fleeting life; ſuch is the Scene upon the earth, that wee muſt be borne ere we could have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as ſoone as we are borne, wee are againe diſſolved to nothing. Wee are a dreame that laſts not, an appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that cannot be laid hold on, a flight of a bird that is gone, the paſſage of a ſhip in the ſea, that leaves behind no impreſſion, duſt, a vapour, morning dew, a flowre that hath his time to blow, and time to wither; the dayes of man are as graſſe, and ſhall flouriſh,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10247:119"/> but like the flowre of the field. Think therefore alwayes what manner of life thou haſt, not how long it may laſt: make haſte to live well, and think eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day is another life; let us extend our life, whoſe office and argument is acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us not place the goodneſſe of our life in the length of it, but in the uſe of it: For it may come to paſſe, yea, it often happens ſo that he who hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long, hath lived little; his life is moſt long, in the whole extent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath been at leaſure for himſelfe, and yet no part thereof hath lyen waſte or idle. Life is like a Play, it skils not how long it is, but how well it was acted; not he that hath ſung much to the Harpe, nor he that hath made many prayers, or hath ſteered many ſhips, is to be commended, but he that hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed theſe things; for Beauty is to be placed in Vertue, and a ſeaſonable moderation, not in length of dayes. In every thing we ſee the Priority to bee yeelded to maturity and perfection, not to their old-age: For amongſt the Plants, thoſe are accompted the beſt which beare moſt fruit in the ſhorteſt time; and amongſt the living creatures, thoſe from whom we receive moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:10247:119"/> for our lives, in the ſhorteſt time. We conclude therefore, that a ſhort time well and innocently ſpent, is farre to be preferred before a ſinfull long life.</p>

            <p>HEare and obey theſe things, O man, which I ſhall utter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy words; weigh well continually with thy ſelfe, that ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, I ſay unto you, that of every idle word that the ſonnes of men ſhall ſpeake, they ſhall give an account for in the day of judgement: and that alſo which the moſt wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> alſo affirmes, in the multitude of words there will not ceaſe to be ſin. Fly (therefore) idle and ſlothfull words, which have repentance tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their heeles, and ill ſucceſſe at their elbowes. Examine what thou art to propoſe, and what to anſwer: As long as thy word is within the fence of thy teeth, it is thine own, but as ſoon as it is eſcaped, it is his that receives it. How foule and uncomely a thing is it,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10247:120"/> if thy unbrideled tongue, breaking the bounds of modeſty, ſhall cauſe thee to bluſh for ſhame? Let therefore thy words be few and weighty, and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſalt; and mark in the delivery, what is worthy, and what in them is unworthy of thee. Chiefly, vaunt of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for truth, which thou knoweſt not to be true; nor give thy ſelfe over to receive vaine reports. Such a tongue is a monſter, more changeable than any <hi>Proteus,</hi> that fils the world with fables, &amp; doth often in ſports cauſe tragedies to be acted amongſt men: it encreaſeth in its progreſſe, and for the moſt part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates things to be greater than they are; and cannot abſtain from telling of lies, in relating a truth: and although it doth onely utter trifles and toyes, yet ſometimes is it in the place of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes. As the hand of a foole doth leave a token of his folly deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered upon every wall it paſſeth by; ſo ſuch a tongue filleth all mens eares with rumours and ſtories; but whether they be true or falſe, it careth not. A mouſe ſcarce peeps out of any cranny, but it is preſently at hand, and like a midwife receives this iſſue, and makes it preſently grow bigge; and that it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:10247:120"/> may ſhew the fairer, cloaths it in moſt large veſtments: ſo he forces ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours upon every one he meets, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freſh and new, yea, as a true ſtory, though for the moſt part it hath ſcarce any truth in it. So is falſhood in very ſhort time divulged thorow the world. Whoſoever heares a report, coynes and addes ſomething to that he hath heard, what either credulity, or ornament ſhal perſwade him too. Behold the ſtories, which doe (at length) put off all ſhew of truth. The wooden engines were (heretofore) framed with that art, that when they were brought forth unto the ſolemnity of the triumphs, they did ſuddenly grow great, &amp; raiſe themſelves to a great heighth: rumours are indeed theſe Pageants, which when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſpread, are accuſtomed ſuddenly to increaſe, and to extend into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible greatneſſe. But O the raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mans minde! we lead a very ſhort life, we have an end as ſoone as we begin: the moſt ſwift time returnes not in his gate, his courſe, nor in his flight, and forſakes us even while we are thinking of vanity, by a flight ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be recalled: And we amidſt theſe precipices of ſwit-footed time, are not
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10247:121"/> only ſlow, but triflers, wear out our beſt dayes in moſt idle bawbles. Our ſwift dayes doe paſſe away, and we alſo are carried away in their motion; we are ſnatched away unawares, whilſt we are toying, and make paſtime to our owne deſtruction. Beleeve not every thing is told thee, nor report all that thou heareſt, except thou intend to loſe thy friends, and to kindle the hatred of many againſt thy ſelfe. Firſt weigh things, before thou judge of them. He that reports things he onely heares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt deceived himſelfe, doth moſt uſually deceive others. Behold how far the eyes and the eares doe ſtand aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! If all that the miners did caſt out of the mines, were ſilver and gold, the world by this time might have beene gilded all over; but whilſt the metall that is digged thence, is ſevered from the droſſe, earth, ſtones, and ſand that is mixed with it, it is brought at length to a ſmall langot: ſo it is with the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of things we heare; if we take away the things which are fained, falſe, and ill underſtood, and thoſe which are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by conjecture; alas what a ſmall ſcantling of pure truth remaines? for the moſt part, halfe that is fained that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10247:121"/> is related in a many-worded Oration. Let the words of the tongue agree with the meaning of the heart, ſhunne falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood &amp; lies. It is eaſie to ſay what a lie is, there needs no long diſpute about it; To ſpeak one thing, &amp; think another, is a lie. To ſpeak againſt a mans minde is a lie. Let not thy breſt conceale one thing, and thy tongue utter another thing. Let no man doubt but he lies, that utters any thing with an intent to deceive. One of the veines ties the tongue &amp; the heart together, another the tongue and braine; by which diſpoſition of the veines, nature teacheth us, that one member is ſo to be governed by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that the tongue may agree with the heart. For this is a lie, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thing hidden in the heart, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing ready at the tongues end: to beleeve in heart that a thing is black, but to affirme in words that it is white. But that you may more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, you muſt know there is a threefold lie, an officious lie, a jeſting lie, and a pernitious lie. An officious lie is ſaid to be that that may be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to profit another, but himſelfe leaſt of all that tels it. They call a jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lie that that hurts no body, but is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10247:122"/> ſpoken by way of fancie; but though a lie ſpoken in jeſt, is not ſo ill as that which is ſpoken to another mans hurt, or for very pleaſure we take in lying, even that alſo becauſe it is a lie, is ſinne; for it is vanity and extravigancie, to take pleaſure in that thing which ſhould be farre diſtant from us; yet it is not called a jeſting lie, if any one ſpeake a falſity, not in earneſt, but in ſuch a jeſting way, that all may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he meaneth other wayes than he ſpeaketh, for in regard there is no ſignification of falſhood, it is not a lie; but that is a lie, when any one relates a falſity for fancies ſake, and that he takes pleaſure in it, and doth doth deſire to perſwade others that he is ſerious. Thirdly, and finally, a pernitious lie is that that is alwayes joyned with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers harme, and is reckoned amongſt ſinnes of a high nature. An officious lie is not ſo called, becauſe any man may excuſe it, by taking upon himſelfe the deceit: Although he that ſinnes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit another, ſinneth leſſe than he that doth it not to this end; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he dealeth not ſimply, and in a right manner; for ill is not to be done, that good may come thereon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10247:122"/> flie, with diligence, all manner of lying, and neither by chance, or of ſet purpoſe ſpeake that which is falſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of lying in all things. This vice is ſo to be avoided, that though the ſafety of many were to be contrived in one lie, and that but only an officious or jeſting lie, yet it would not be lawfull for thee to tell it. Yea if any one by a ſlight lie could rid his parents, or any more dear to him than his parents from devouring flames, yet might he not lawfully tell a lie; it would be better to forſake them amidſt the flames, than by an untruth to offend thy God. But thou wilt ſay, this is a hard ſaying; it is rigid, yet it is true. Haſt thou not read? <hi>Let us doe evill, that good may come thereon, whoſe damnation is juſt.</hi> All doctrine of truth ſhall in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be taken away, if we yeeld to moſt licentious falſhood, if any place be any where left open to a lie, though it be but an officious one: for whoſoever lies, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to himſelfe, his owne, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others temporall commodity, than which, what can be done more perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Certainly, an injury offered to God is greater than all the ill we can doe unto man. How many thouſand of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10247:123"/> moſt holy martyrs, would rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digally powre forth their bloods by drops, than conſent with one lie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their innocencies. But if our very life be not to be preferred before the truth, what can be objected to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine we may lawfully lie, by thoſe that are of opinion we ought ſometimes to lie? Be gone then, let every lie, I ſay, be gone, becauſe it hath the devill for its authour, who himſelfe neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the truth, nor is there any truth in him. Lying lips are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord; but thoſe that deale faithfully, are pleaſing unto him. If thou know any thing that a good man in other things hath done, and thou haſt long concealed it with the cloake of charity, doe not in thy wrath reveale it, that no man may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe thee of paſſion, and to have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious minde; and that others doe not that to thee, which thou ſhouldeſt not do to others, I adviſe thee not to reveale thy ſelfe and all thy ſecrets to any but a true pious &amp; honeſt man; thou needeſt not feare ſuch a one, becauſe for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charities ſake, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all friendſhip, he will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, willingly pardon thy offences,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10247:123"/> nor will at all reproach thee. Doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo in any mans preſence, which may cauſe thee to feare that thou maiſt raiſe up miſchiefe to thy ſelfe, or make a friend become thine enemy. That which thou wouldeſt have ſecret, keepe thou it ſecret, and reveale it to no man; yet remember God can ſee thorow the thickeſt clouds. Finde no fault with others, but looke to thy ſelfe. Avoid biting reprovers and obſcene jeſters; yet if at any time thou wilt jeſt civilly, propoſe three things to thy ſelfe; firſt, abuſe not the phraſe of Scripture to make up thy jeſt, and ſo defile thy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; what canſt thou imagine that God thinks, when he ſees and heares ſuch things among Chriſtians that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his name, that would be thought wiſer than others, and yet account this for no ſinne? That I may not ſpeake of the grievous offence that many take hereat, and that they are troubled and made ſad with the worſt ſort of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, who cannot (afterwards) read or heare Gods Word, or pray with the ſame devotion they were wont (before) to doe; very nature it ſelfe alſo teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that we ought not to deale ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly, negligently and idly, in ſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10247:124"/> grave and holy words. He that conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his own conſcience, finds they be ſuch obſcenities, fooliſh bablings and ribauldry that are not fitting for Chriſtians. Secondly, let not thy jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weaken Chriſtian charity. Thirdly, let them not violate honeſty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie. Never ſpeak of God but with feare and reverence, and as it were in his preſence, who is moſt preſent every where. For ſeeing we are not worthy to take his holy Name in our mouthes, much leſſe decent is it for us to profane it with our lips; it is a ſure ſigne of a wicked mind to uſe Gods Name upon all light occaſions. Pray therefore with <hi>David, Let the words of my mouth, and meditations of my heart be acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee.</hi> Be finally ſparing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending any man, but ready to ſalute any one; gentle in giving reſpect; cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in admoniſhing; mercifull in pardoning; faithfull in performing thy promiſes; ready to requite good; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convert thou the reward of vertue into a gift of courteſie.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>HEarken and be obedient, O man, touching thy deeds: doe no evill, though thou mayeſt doe it; for the leaſt ſins, except they be ſeriouſly repented of, are not ſuffered to goe unpuniſhed. Let it not grieve thee to doe good; doe nothing againſt thy vocation; if thou begin any thing, in the firſt place pray earneſtly unto God for his aſſiſtance; then ſet confidently upon thy worke, and leave the iſſue thereof to God; if thou undertake any thing, in thy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, truſt to Gods providence, though the meanes thou uſeſt, ſeeme inſufficient unto thee; and if they offer themſelves, as it were unto thy hands of their own accord, reſolve that they are offered thee from God; yet place not greater hope in them than in God, but beſeech him mercifully to bleſſe thoſe meanes: have a heavenly minde in earthly things, and doe what thou art able; commit the reſt to the guidance of the moſt holy Trinity: never uſe unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10247:125"/> meanes, for that can bring no gaine with it that brings deſtruction to the ſoule. For this end labour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly that thy conſcience be pure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man. If at any time thou be enticed to ſin, think Satan lodgeth neare thee, and that it is a reproachfull thing for the ſonnes of men, that are ſo well beloved of God, and ſo gently dealt with by him, to gratifie ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane a ſpirit, to the diſhonour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of thy God: To the reproach, I ſay, of thy God, becauſe every vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſinne is a reproach offered to God. No Prince will endure this of thee; and how ſhall God ſuffer, who is a God of all Majeſty and Glory, that a reproach offered to his Majeſty, ſo often renewed, and ſo often with ſecuritie committed againſt him, ſhall goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed? As often as we commit ſin by a deliberate counſell againſt our conſcience, we doe (in a ſort) conſult of it before (though we oftentimes doe not marke and perceive it;) on one ſcale we put the profit, pleaſure, or delight of ſin, in the other our loſſe, the wrath of God, and our offences againſt him. What madneſſe is it now, what perverſeneſſe, what malice, what reproach to prefer a
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10247:125"/> moment before eternitie, a drop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ocean, one graine of ſand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a mountain, our owne luſts before the incomparable Omnipotencie and Majeſtie of God? Doſt thou not, O man, as often as thou ſinneſt, ſtrike, as it were, the infinite God with thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricidiall hand? Aske continually thy conſcience theſe two things; whether if any ſuch thing befall thee, thou art to be acquitted? What if thou ſhalt doe any ſuch thing in the very day wherein all the world muſt receive its doome? Whether thou canſt give an anſwer to the univerſall Judge, when thou ſhalt be forced to give a reaſon for all thy Actions? Remember <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that thought that God ſaw what no man could perceive. God is juſt, hee ſhall draw thy ſins to the light that thou haſt committed in ſecret. When <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed <hi>Bathſeba</hi> by his unlawfull lying with her; Who ſaw his adultery but God? Hee brought forth his ſecret pleaſures to the view of all Iſrael; and will alſo at length diſcover thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto all men. Satan is ſubtill, even in this one thing, that by flattering thy ſelfe, thou mayſt accompt thy ſelfe but a ſmall ſinner, and ſo may draw
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10247:126"/> thee into his net; but if thou deſire to avoid ſin, ſhun the occaſion of ſinning; let that which is good, pleaſe thee for Gods ſake, and let God pleaſe thee for his own ſake; if God favour thee, feare no mans perſecution; God ſhall make thine enemie thy friend, or ſhall ſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per him, that he ſhall doe thee but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hurt; no man can be overcome by his enemie, but he who was firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſin, and ſo made himſelfe hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto God. Deprive no man of the reſpect that is due unto him, yet alwaies reckon with thy ſelfe that reſpect is more due to godlineſſe than to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if God increaſe thy ſubſtance in this life, think it is a ſpur of thy thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and an incitement to deſire thoſe heavenly things, and an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pietie; neither be proud either of thy externall or internall gifts; for outward things as they ſeldome hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or come unto thee, ſo they fall off &amp; ſpeedily depart from thee: God gave thee indeed thy inward graces, yet hee can take them from thee before thou be aware, if any abuſe them, and forget God the giver of them. It may be thou haſt many vertues, and it may be thou art disfigured by many vices that doe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10247:126"/> diſpleaſe him more than the others doe pleaſe him. It is not enough that others commend thee, except thine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doe approve thee; no fame is perpetuall, but that which ariſeth from godlineſſe. We reade no where in Gods Booke that an hypocrite was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and what wonder? for whereas the converſion of ſinners is a meanes to turne from ſin; what meanes of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is left for him that turnes repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it ſelfe into ſinne, which is the meanes of ſalvation? O miſerable ſoule that deſires to ſee holy things, and lives a heatheniſh life! Obſerve in what a manner the wicked end their dayes, ſo that thou mayeſt deteſt their lives. See how the godly end their lives, that thou mayeſt run the ſame courſe as they doe. Obey thy Superiours, honour thoſe that are wiſe; keepe company with thoſe that be honeſt and religiouſly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And ſeeing mans corrupt nature doth much love hypocriſie; touch not, nor uſe the Sacrament before thou have founded the depth of thine owne heart moſt accurately. Rule over thoſe that are ſubject to thy command, more by courteſie than ſeverity; courteſie is full of hope, and tyranny of feare: Gods
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10247:127"/> juſtice will not ſuffer a tyrant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long, for though ſubjects, both by Gods laws and alſo by mans, ought to yeeld obedience to Magiſtrates, yet the Magiſtrates themſelves are but Gods Miniſters; and if wee conſider them as they are Chriſtians, they are not only ſervants, but our brethren al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Chriſt: Chriſtians therefore muſt rule like Chriſtians, in charity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as Chriſt hath taught us by his own example. Art thou made a Judge? give right judgement, remembring that thy ſelfe muſt appeare before Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat: he is curſed that bleſſeth the wicked; but bleſſed that bleſſeth the bleſſed. O man, how dangerous is mans life, what a great account hath he to give, what a ſhort ſpace is it, but thou muſt appeare at Gods Tribunall? What then muſt thou doe? What deed haſt thou committed? How wouldeſt thou appeare, if thou wert this houre to depart? If thou wert to appeare this moment before thy Examiner? It would quickly be determined concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thee: Thou art to day a man, ſhalt thou appeare to morrow? O dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hardneſſe of mans heart, that only meditates upon things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10247:127"/> and foreſees nothing what ſhall be hereafter! Thou oughteſt ſo to behave thy ſelfe in every action, as if thou wert this day to dye; in the morning think thou mayſt not live to the evening, and in the evening dare not promiſe thy ſelfe the next enſuing morning: be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prepared, and ſo live, that death may never take thee unprovided. How happie and wiſe is he that labours to be ſuch whilſt he lives, as he wiſheth to be found at his death! O Jeſu, give me the perfect contempt of the world; give me a fervent deſire to profit in vertue; give me the love of inſtruction, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of repentance, the readineſſe of obedience. O my God, grant that I may deſire thee in my heart, to ſeeke thee in my deſires, to find thee in my ſearch, and love thee being found. Give me, my Lord and God, repentance for my heart, contrition to my ſpirit, a flood of teares to my eyes, and a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſtribution of almes to my hands. O my King, extinguiſh in me the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the fleſh, and kindle in mee the fire of thy love. O my Redeemer, drive out of me the ſpirit of pride, and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably grant me the treaſure of thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. O my Saviour, remove from

O my Creator, pluck out all rancour out of my mind, and beſtow on me the ſweetneſſe of a milde ſpirit: give mee, moſt mercifull Father, a firme faith, a congruous hope, and continuall chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: my Governour, doe thou divert all vanity from mee, all inconſtancie of mind, wandring of the heart, ſcurrility of the tongue, pride of the eyes, gluttony of the belly, reproaching of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the ſins of detraction, the itch of curioſity, the deſire of riches, the extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great men, the deſire of vain-glory, the evill of hypocriſie, the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of flattery, the contempt of the poore, the oppreſſion of the weak, the thirſt of covetouſneſſe, the ruſt of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and the death of blaſphemie. O my Maker, cut off from me raſhneſſe, iniquity, lewdneſſe, diſquietneſſe, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, drowſineſſe, ſloth, dulneſſe of mind, blindneſſe of heart, obſtinacie of ſenſe, bloodineſſe of conditions, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to goodneſſe, reſiſtance of good counſell, unbridleneſſe of my tongue, preying upon the poore, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weak, ſlandering the innocent, neglecting my inferiours, cruelty in my

There thou haſt adopted me for thy ſonne, and made me thy heire; there make I that wonderfull covenant with thee, that I ſhould be thine, and that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be mine; that thou ſhouldeſt be my Lord, and I ſhould be thy ſervant; that thou ſhouldeſt be my father, and I ſhould be thy ſonne: there is it ſo ſo covenanted betwixt us, that thou ſhouldeſt manifeſt thy fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, and that I ſhould with a fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all obedience hearken unto thee. What need I rehearſe the other uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, namely, that thou haſt made it the curing phyſicke of our ſins, that by thine own blood thou mighteſt heal my unhappy and feſtring wounds, and mighteſt thereby more and more adde perfection unto me? But though I have received ſo many bleſſings of thee, and have in a readineſſe ſo many antidotes againſt ſinne; yet have I not continued in obedience, but have often broken
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10247:132"/> that covenant, and yet haſt thou bin ſo mercifull and ſo milde a God, that thou didſt endure my diſobedience. O God, my ſalvation and hope, how can I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thy mercy and clemency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of teares? for how often, O juſt judge, mighteſt thou kill, and bring me to nothing, and yet none of theſe things is befallen me? how many thouſands of ſoules are already thruſt into hell to be puniſhed with eternall plagues and fire, that never came neare my ſinnes either in number or weight; and yet am not I burned? what had become of me if thou hadſt cut me off, together with them? How ought I to feare thy terrible and fearfull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou ſhouldeſt puniſh me in thy immutable and ſevere judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the foulneſſe of my iniquities? O my God, who tied thy hands? who was my Interceſſor, when I moſt ſecurely ſlept the ſleep of ſin? who held the ſcourge of thy wrath, when as day by day I provoked &amp; urged thy ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance? what was there in me to pleaſe thee? what was there in me ſo worthy of thy acceptation, that thou ſhouldeſt ſpare me when thou didſt root out others, who wallowing in the mud of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10247:132"/> their ſinnes, thou didſt ſummon to thy moſt righteous judgement ſeat in the midſt of their dayes? My ſins did cry to heaven, and thou didſt ſtop thine eares; my wickedneſſes were daily multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thy mercy was likewiſe encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to me; I did ſinne, and thou didſt expect my repentance; I fled from thee, and thou didſt draw neare to me; I provoked thee ſo often to wrath, that I might weary thee by my provocations; yet waſt not thou weary of taking pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon me, as if my tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, being abominable ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in me, were pleaſing in thy ſight. Thou haſt ſuggeſted unto me many good thoughts, and given me many profitable admonitions, to turne me from my tranſgreſſions, even in my full ſpeed of ſinning. How many times, ſtanding before the doore of my heart, haſt thou knocked and called, ſaying, Returne, returne thou degenerate ſon, nor will I ſet my face againſt thee, ſo that thou wilt acknowledge the ſinnes, by which thou haſt offended thy God? How often haſt thou called me unto thee by this moſt pleaſing voice? How often haſt thou exhorted me by great feare, by moſt terrible threats, by the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10247:133"/> daily expectation of daily danger, of perpetuall death and ſtrict judgement? how many preachers haſt thou afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me? how many teachers haſt thou ſet over me, who partly by doctrine, and partly by example, ſhould ſhew me the way I ſhould walke in? Thou haſt allured me by moſt gentle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, thou haſt chaſtiſed me by dangerous ſickneſſes, and other miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and haſt left out nothing that might induce me from the old way. What ſhall I render unto thee, O Lord, for all thy bleſſings beſtowed upon me? I owe thee my ſelfe, and all things I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, becauſe thou haſt created me, for thou madeſt me, and what ever I have. Againe, I owe thee my ſelfe, and all things I poſſeſſe, becauſe thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved me: beſides, Lord, thou gaveſt thy ſelfe to be my great and plenteous reward. What can I render unto thee? If I had in my hand all the lives of all the Angels, and all the ſoules of all mankinde, and I ſhould reſolve to pay them to thee; they could not ſtand in compariſon with one drop of thy blood ſhed for me; therefore I moſt worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaine, and cry out, who ſhall give water to my head, and a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10247:133"/> of teares to my eyes, and I will weepe night and day, and deplore mine owne abominable ingratitude, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I thy creature, O my beſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, have repayed thee, for all thy ſo many, and ſo great, and ſo incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible benefits beſtowed upon me. Helpe me, O my God, impart thy grace unto me, that I may with inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition confeſſe unto thee my back-ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from thee. Ah! Lord, I am thy creature, though moſt unhappy and unworthy of thee my Creator. Thou didſt create me according to thine own image and ſimilitude; looke backe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, O God, take from me what ever I have brought in, and then thou ſhalt finde nothing but good in me, and that which thou haſt beſtowed upon me, O thou moſt perfect worker of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Alas! I have reſiſted the powers of thy holy will, and ſtriven much to oppoſe thee. Oh, with what ſecurity have I given my ſelf over to wrath! my feet made haſte to doe evill, my hands prepared themſelves to doe miſchiefe, to covetouſneſſe, and all manner of impurities; my eyes were turned to behold vanity, my eares were open to receive lies, filthy talking, ſlandering
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:10247:134"/> and reproaching. My ſoule, that was a moſt noble ſoule, and neare (in nature) to thy heavenly Miniſters, and ought to have contemplated, to beheld, and have reflected upon thee, turnes backe from thy unſpeakable beauty, and turnes it ſelfe towards the flattering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull beauty of the world; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured this with care, that it might abuſe the fraile goods of this world to her owne luſts, and knew not how grievous and hurtfull this would prove unto her. This (behold) is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding part of my ſoule! let us ſee what good may proceed from the will? Thou haſt enclined, O Lord, my will to heavenly riches, but it hath declined to earthly things, and hath wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled her ſelfe by a vaine love unto them: this, O Lord, is that grace, which I have repayed thee for thy moſt precious gifts. What ſhall I anſwer thee (ah! Lord,) if thou ſhouldeſt call me before thy judgement ſeat, and ſhouldeſt ſay, I have planted thee for a noble vine, and that thou ſhouldeſt (wholly) be a faithfull ſeed, how then are you changed into degenerate bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a wilde vine? But if I ſtand in ſo foule a condition, upon examination
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10247:134"/> of the benefit of my Creation, what will it prove if I ſhould give an account of the benefits of my Preſervation? For thou haſt preſerved him ſo many dayes, ſo many moneths, ſo many yeares, who hath dedicated all his ſenſes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and deſpite of all thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, who hath perſecuted thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who hath beene a ſcandall to the communion of thy Saints, who hath ſtrengthened and enlarged the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſinners. Thou haſt preſerved the tongue that hath blaſphemed thee and taken thy Name in vaine; thou haſt preſerved the members that have moſt vehemently offended thee; thou haſt given him meat and drinke, that hath abuſed them both to thine owne reproach. I have not beene onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, but I armed my ſelfe with thine owne bleſſings againſt thee. Thou createdſt all thy creatures for me, even for my profit, and to draw me to love thee, and I have uſed thy creatures to the inexcuſable hatred of thee. Thoſe things which ought to have brought me to thy moſt beautifull wiſdome, did make me blinde, and made me not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to looke up but did even cloſe mine eyes that I ſhould not behold
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10247:135"/> how much the Creator did excell thoſe his ſo many faire and comely crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for the moſt rare Artiſt of all beauty and comelineſſe, was He that that created them. Thou gaveſt me all things, that I ſhould yeeld and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate my ſelfe unto thee: thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have all things ſerve me, that I might ſerve thee, even I that have ſo little thought upon thee. Thy creatures, according to thy command, are ready at thy becke, but I, alas, have ſtoutly refuſed thy commandements. Thou haſt given me health of body, and I have granted the uſe thereof to the devill: thou haſt given me ſtrength under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and a will, and I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed them upon the ſervice of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. And what ſhall I ſay? as many dangers and loſſes of other men as I have beheld, ſo many of thy bleſſings towards my ſelfe have I ſeene, that thou didſt not overwhelme me in the ſame dangers and loſſes. If thou ſhouldeſt ſend me what I deſerve, thou mighteſt finde me more worthy ſo many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries than others are; but it is thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O Lord, that I am not conſumed. Beaſts are tamed by courteſies, are made gentle and familiar for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10247:135"/> and obedience of man; and yet thy benefits have not tamed me, have not moved me, that I might ſay in my heart, <hi>Let us feare the Lord our God, that giveth us raine, the early and the later raine it its ſeaſon,</hi> preſerving for us the fulneſſe of the yearly harveſt; that enricheth us with his bleſſings, that preſerveth us from our birth even to our death; Ought not theſe things to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes and minde, thy favour and mercy towards me? But if I am ſo much bound unto thee for theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which thou haſt produced for me by the bare power of thy Word, what ſhall I be indebted to thee for redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me from eternall death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by the precious blood of thine only begotten ſon? Oh, how much have I neglected thy moſt wiſe counſell? how have I deſpiſed thy incarnation, which I ought to adore? Thou my God, art made man, that thou mighteſt make me partaker of the divine nature; and I a moſt perverſe wretch, am turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beaſt, and become the devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. Thou didſt deſcend from the moſt glorious throne of thy heavenly Father, unto mee that devill upon earth, and I have not elevated my ſelfe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10247:136"/> unto thee, nor would I aſcend with thee; but by the works of the fleſh I have beene faſter tied to the more baſe things of the earth, and have preſſed my ſelfe downe into the mud, by the weight of my ſinnes, wherein I have long lien wallowing. Thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me out of the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and I of mine owne accord have enſnared my ſelfe in his devilliſh toiles. Thou art made one body with me, and I by my voluntary ſinnes have plucked my ſelfe off from thee, and have glued my ſelfe to the body of the wicked. So many thy wondrous works could not force me to acknowledge thee: So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny teſtimonies of thy love could not ſoften my ſtony heart, to make me love thee againe; thy ſo great merit could not raiſe me up, to cauſe me to place all my hope in thee. That thy moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Juſtice, which ſhines moſt clearly out, and that many wayes, out of the worke of our Redemption, could not hold me, ſo that I might conſider the plagues and puniſhments which thou heapedſt upon thy onely beloved Son, for my ſake, and cauſe me to cry out, <hi>If they have done theſe things in the greene tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:10247:136"/> Thy ſo many torments and paines could not perſwade me to deſcend into my ſelf, and to conſider with what hatred thou perſueſt our ſinnes, for which thou haſt permitted thy very Sonne to be moſt cruelly afflicted. For theſe things ought I to have ſtood in awe, and to reverence thy great Name. So haſt thou (my Jeſus) humbled thy ſelfe, that he that conſiders it, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and with trembling behold thee; yet am I growne proud, and at this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time, alas, doe exalt my ſelfe above my brethren. Thou didſt hang naked upon the Croſſe, yet I not content with ſuch cloathing as was neceſſary to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my nakedneſſe, have ſought after exceſſe and ſuperfluity, and have moſt tenderly handled my ſlimy damnable body. Thou didſt ſuffer intolerable thirſt in thy extreame plagues and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and didſt taſte gall mingled with vinegar; but I muſt (as it were) be fatted to the ſlaughter with luſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wines; I have beene overcharged with gluttony and ravenouſneſſe, and have thereby made my ſelfe ſtrong in fleſhly deſires. Thou didſt beare all things that thy Father laid upon thee, nor didſt throw off the the burden, till
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10247:137"/> thou mighteſt truely ſay it is finiſhed; but I have eſteemed it very troubleſome and tedious for me to ſuffer but a very little for thee. Thou that art the bleſſed Son of God, didſt ſuffer blows on the face from wicked wretches; but I, if I be but touched with a finger, or wronged in a word, doe preſently burne with wrath, and am moſt bitterly moved to indignation, that am but a worme, and not worthy the name of a man, and doe deſerve, by reaſon of my filthy ſins, not only moſt vile reproach, but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; ſcorne of hell it ſelfe. And what ſhall I farther ſay of my moſt wicked life? Thou didſt moſt willingly die, that I might die to ſin, and live to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; but I too much relying on this thy mercy, doe wittingly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ruſh into ſins. What greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace could I put upon thee? I have made thy mercies the occaſion of my uncleanneſſe, and have uſed ſo precious a meanes of my Redemption, which ought to make every one to hate ſin, to the ſtrengthning and continuation of my ſins. I thought ſins were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me, becauſe thou waſt ſo gentle and mercifull; and for giving mee ſo many bleſſings, I have requited thee
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:10247:137"/> with my infamous deeds, ſo that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the remedy ordained againſt ſin, into the meanes to make me ſin more freely, and have ſet the point of that ſword againſt mine owne breſt, and well-nigh deſtroyed my ſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that thou gaveſt me to reſiſt the blowes of Satan. Thou art he only, O Lord, that dyed for us all, that they that live, might not live to themſelves, but to him that did both die, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for us; but I, contrary to this, have lived to my ſelfe and mine owne luſts, as if thou hadſt dyed for that end that I ſhould live to fill my ſoule with fleſhly deſires: and abuſing thy grace, I ſhould weave the web of miſchiefe. O Lord, how great is thy patience, that thou wouldeſt be buffetted for my ſake! but much greater is thy patience, that thou enduredſt ſo many ſinners in the world, that even buffet thee with their ſins? But ſhall this thy patience laſt for ever? I call to mind what thou threatneſt againſt the impenitent; I ſee that the earth which is watered with raine and brings forth no fruit, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by curſing; I ſee that the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard well manured, and yet remaining unfruitfull, is waſted and trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10247:138"/> foot: O hard, and iron heart! O unprofitable and drie wood! Doſt thou not tremble if thou heareſt the voice of the Omnipotent God, ſaying; <hi>Every branch, not bearing fruit, will my Father take away; if any remaine not in me, hee ſhall be cast out as a branch, and it withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and men gather it up, and caſt it into the fire to bee burnt.</hi> What man can be ſo careleſſe, that trembles not and ſhakes not for feare of ſo horrible a judgement? How deafe and ſluggiſh is he that heareth not this voice? With what a ſtupidneſſe is he drowned in? in what a lethargie is he buried, who is not awaked with this thunder? Ah! Lord, this earthly tabernacle hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto delighted mee; I have walked amidſt thornes and thiſtles, that have choaked the ſeed of thy Word ſowen in me, ſo that I have had no deſire to know thy will; my luſts have ſeduced me, my deſires have driven me up and downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my thoughts have diſturbed mee, the worme of my conſcience gnawes me; and all theſe have I eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as ſecure delights, and reckoned troubles to be peace. What ſhall I doe my God? What ſhall I doe? I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confeſſe that I am not worthy to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10247:138"/> come before thee; I bluſh for my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe ſake to lift up mine eyes unto thee; I dare not lift them up to ſeeke thy favour and moſt mercifull preſence; if thou wilt puniſh me as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, nor heaven, nor earth can hide me from thee; but thou wilt not, O Lord, my God, that any one periſh, but that all may be converted and live: thou createdſt mee for thy praiſe; but who in hell, where thou art blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhall praiſe thy Name? Thou didſt pay ſo great a ranſome for me; yet if thou reject me in theſe my moſt great neceſſities, who ſhall receive me? if thou ſhalt refuſe thy creature, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by ſo great a price, who ſhall helpe me? Why, even thou my Father, that Father of mercy, even that mercy which is immeaſurable, which is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: And although by my diſobedience I have loſt the right of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: yet, O my Father, thou haſt not loſt the heart of a Father; though I have fallen from thee my Father, yet wilt not thou fall from me, or ceaſe to be my Father; that word never failed, <hi>As I live, I will not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that hee may bee converted and live.</hi> And although my ſins be innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10247:139"/> and my wounds may ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, yet art not thou ignorant of a way to cure me; confirme therefore and fulfill thy promiſes, waſh me effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the blood of thy Son, that, as to me, his death prove not in vaine: I am (as well) a part of his fleſh, and he a part of mine, as <hi>Peter, David,</hi> or <hi>Paul;</hi> he is as well to me an <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> as to any other: Hee bare the ſins of the whole world; and therefore hee bore mine alſo. Looke back therefore, look back therefore, O Lord, upon this loſt ſheepe, regard thy creature, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him in thy fury whom thou haſt made with thy hands: take care, O Lord, of the ſoule, which thou haſt redeemed; I come creeping to thee, wounded with many wounds; but thou moſt experienced Phyſitian of ſoules, and Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Bleſſed are they whoſe ſins are forgiven, and whoſe offences are covered: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not ſin. Rejoyce in the Lord, ô ye righteous, for praiſe becommeth the Juſt; taſte, and ſee; for the Lord is ſweet: Bleſſed is the man, that hopeth

Bleſſe the Lord, ô my ſoule, and all that is within me, praiſe his holy Name, who is mercifull to all thy iniquities, and healeth all thy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who hath redeemed thy life from deſtruction, who crowneth thee with mercy and pity. His goodneſſe and mercy ſhall follow me, all the dayes of my life, and I ſhall dwell in the Houſe of the Lord, for evermore. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and beſeech thee, ô God by the death of thine owne ſon, give me thy Spirit, to purifie my heart, and with his grace to ſtrengthen me, that by mine own unadviſedneſſe I fall not thither whence by thy mercy I have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Create in me, ô God, a new heart, and renew a firme ſpirit within me; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation, and uphold me by thy free ſpirit. Waſh mee daily, by pardoning my daily offences, tranſlate me from the fennes of this age, and the mud of this preſent life, to the excellent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of thy glory, where is neither ſcab, nor blindneſſe, nor doth any one ſuffer any uncleane iſſue of blood, nor is any one uncleane; where is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need of a lavacre, thy glorious body being joyned unto our body.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10247:142"/> Thou muſt needs fulfill thy promiſe made, and both finiſh, and confirme the good worke thou haſt begun in me; through Chriſt our only Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Amen.</p>

            <p>I Will make an entrance unto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of God, even to the God that maketh my youth rejoyce. Laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the garments of my inveterate ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I will renew my youth like an Eagle, and haſten to approach that heavenly banquet. A plentifull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate banquet is prepared, which is a medicine to the ſicke, a way to thoſe that wander, a banquet that comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the weake, delights thoſe that are in health, cures ſickneſſe, preſerves health; a banquet that makes a man more pliant to reproofe, more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to labour, more zealous to love, more wiſe to warineſſe, more ready to obedience, more devout to thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; a banquet by which our daily ſinnes are forgiven, the powers of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan expelled, ſtrength given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10247:143"/> even martyrdome it ſelfe; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, a banquet by which all good things are brought unto thee, becauſe a man partaking of it, doth even become the ſame thing he receives. This ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet compared with <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his banquet, reliſheth farre above it; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with the table ſpread in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe for the children of Iſrael, and it refreſheth thee far more. For though that Table contained in it the figure of this our Euchariſt, when God rained downe Manna for our Fathers in the Wilderneſſe, and they were daily fed with food from heaven, and men did eat Angels bread, yet they that did eat that bread, did die; but this living bread that is ſet before thee in this coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banquet, did come from heaven, and hath given life to the world. That Manna came from heaven, this from above the heavens. That being reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the next day was full of worms, this is free from all corruption: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall religiouſly taſte thereof, ſhall not ſee corruption. That was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Fathers after their paſſage over the red ſea, where the Egyptians were drowned, and the Iſraelites were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; ſo this heavenly Manna can
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10247:143"/> profit none but the regenerate: That corporall bread ſuſtained the ancient people in their paſſage thorow the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe to the Land of promiſe; this heavenly food ſuſtaines the faithfull of theſe times in their paſſage to heaven. <hi>Moſes</hi> was Maſter of their Table, and here Chriſt is ready at hand, who hath furniſhed this Table, and bleſſed it. For it is not man that makes the bread and wine, ſet on this Table, to be the body and blood of Chriſt, but Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that is crucified for us; words are uttered by the Prieſts mouth, but the things ſet before thee are conſecrated by the power of Chriſt, who uſed theſe words unto his Diſciples, <hi>This is my Bodie, this is the Cup of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my Blood, which is ſhed for you.</hi> It is Chriſt in whom doth dwell all the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily, who is the power of God, unto whom is given all power in heaven and earth: Hee, when hee was to put an end to the Ceremonies of the Law, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for himſelfe the Paſſeover; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would be condemned to death, and be nailed to the Croſſe, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed according to the ſolemnitie to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Paſſeover, the roaſted lambe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10247:144"/> unleavened bread, and ſowre herbs. When this Supper was ſo prepared, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt theſe ſacramentall dainties, both the old and alſo the new inſtitutions offered themſelves to him; and having eaten the Lambe that the old tradition did ſet before them, This great Maſter ſets before his Diſciples a meat not to be conſumed; nor are here the people invited to a banquet made exquiſite both by coſt and paines, but the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of immortality is given them, differing from common food, keeping the forme of a corporeall ſubſtance, but by the inviſible efficacie of the divine power working in us, and proving Gods eſpeciall preſence accompanying it. Come hither yee faithfull ſoules, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and recollect your ſelves, cheere and fill your ſelves; joyne in one by your faith, your remembrance of Chriſt, with the application of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, with hearty thankſgiving for your deliverance, made through his blood; receive the pledge, teſtimony and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of your holy communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt your Head; and (by him) with the Father and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt alſo: encreaſe, cheriſh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and hold faſt the faith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

Encourage your ſelves to the ſtudie of good works. How too often are we hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſtopt, and grow ſtupid in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this work? Here Chriſt keepes us company, in exhibiting unto us his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and blood: hee doth daily more and more mortifie in us the body of ſinne, and beginne in us the newneſſe of a ſpirituall life: performe each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the offices of concord, peace and love, for we eat the ſame fleſh, we drink the ſame blood, we are nouriſhed with the ſame food; we are refreſhed with the ſame drink: we are made one body under the ſame head; but who hath ever ſeene the members of one and the ſame body to diſagree, to ſtrive, jarre or contend? Caſt out rancour, pluck up hatred, purge out the old leaven. The faithfull under the Goſpell muſt not be made of leaven: The holy Banquet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires pure and ſincere mindes: The ſweet ſavour that comes from Chriſts ſcorching upon the Croſſe, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct all crudities of our carnall ſenſes,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10247:145"/> and doth harden and ſettle the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the minde; nor let there bee any ſpot in the Sacrament of the holy Church, but pure ſimplicity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of life in one houſe, the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church. Chriſt is offered to the faithfull departing out of Aegypt, being cleanſed in their affections by his blood, in their paſſage in the red Sea. O Jeſu Chriſt, our omnipotent Lord God, thou Fountaine of life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, thou Creator of every viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible thing, that art the eternall Son of the everlaſting Father, who of thy abundant goodneſſe in the laſt times didſt take our fleſh upon thee, and waſt delivered and crucified for us ſinfull and unthankful creatures; thou by thine owne blood haſt reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our nature corrupted by ſin, and giveſt me thy fleſh for my food: But thou art a fire, and conſumeſt thoſe that be unworthy; deſtroy me not, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; rather come into the union of my members, into all my ſinewes, into my reines, into my heart: burne up the ſting of my ſinnes, cleanſe my ſoule, ſanctifie my minde, enlighten my five ſenſes, glew me firmely to thy ſelfe in love, alwayes protect and defend mee;

Let thy holy body be made everlaſting Bread unto mee: Mercifull Lord, let thy precious blood become a remedy of ſundry diſeaſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; fearfull and wicked wretch that I am, defiled with abſurd works, I am unworthy of thy pure body, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly blood: O Chriſt, doe thou make me worthy to be partaker of thee; give me, O Chriſt, the drops of teares, to waſh my filthy heart, that having a pure conſcience, I may come in faith and feare to receive thy heavenly gifts. O moſt mercifull Saviour, let thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted body and divine blood be made unto mee the participation of thy holy Spirit, eternall life, and a change of my ſufferings and miſeries. Heale the wounds of my ſoule, O Lord, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie me through-out, and make mee unworthy wretch, worthy to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of thy myſticall divine Supper; be

O holy Word of God, God himſelfe; ſanctifie mee throughly, that am comming to thy divine myſteries. Deſpiſe mee not, O Chriſt, when I receive the bread, which is thy body, and whilſt (wretch that I am) I am made partaker of thy moſt pure and fearfull myſteries, that they prove not condemnation unto me. But let them be unto me, O Chriſt, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and everlaſting life.

The Sunne breaks forth of the clouds, and day ſucceeds in the place of night: one day alſo ſhall break forth the eternall day, after the long laſting nights are paſt, and the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall returne with his glorious light, whom many thouſands of Saints ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſhining moſt beautifully, and farre above the brightneſſe of our Sun. So prepare thy ſelfe, O my ſoule, in this entry, that in that day thou maiſt have admittance into the houſe it ſelfe; nor that the Sunne may hide his face from thee, and thou be involved in thicke darkneſſe. Let no flattering of gaine, no invitation of honour, nor delight of pleaſure ſo ſeduce thee, that thou loſe the gladneſſe of that day. Let the brute beaſts be they that do only behold the light of this our Sun, doe thou with the eyes of faith behold the light of that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10247:149"/> day. Remember, O man, that the devill like a roaring lion, walketh about night and day, ſeeking whom he may devoure. Doſt thou doubt whether he be about thy bed when thou art buried in ſleepe, and that he then labours to devoure thee? but who reſiſteth him? why thou weake wretch, art laid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate before him: It is the onely keeper of Iſrael that neither ſlumbers not ſleeps, that preſerveth thee. Doſt thou heare the cocke crowing? thinke upon <hi>Peter,</hi> who though he was eminent in the dignity of being an Apoſtle, and did heare the great Doctor, the Son of God, yet did he greatly erre. What ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee, thinkeſt thou? except by thy fervent prayers thou daily ſtick cloſe unto God. Thinke thou heareſt that heavenly trumpet which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, the Judges companion, ſhall blow, and conſider how thou couldeſt ſtand before that Judge if he were now come, and did preſently exact thee to appeare before him. Remember God is about and in thy bed, and by his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth looke into all thy thoughts, and ſees all thy behaviour and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Call to minde the holy troops of Angels, which by night defend thee,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10247:150"/> ſtand about thee, obſerve thy ſleeping and waking, and that rejoyce at thy holineſſe, and grieve at thy ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Live therefore ſo as if thou didſt live in the ſight of God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and thus, if thou beeſt wiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve thou doſt. When thou putteſt on thy cloaths, remember they are the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings of ſinne, nor is there any cauſe thou ſhouldeſt be proud of them. What I pray is moſt of our cloaths? are they not the rejected things, the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſpoiles of beaſts? it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore for a man that is endued with reaſon, to be proud, and to brag of the reliques, the excrements and ſpoiles of brute beaſts. Thou cloatheſt thy body with a covering; but think this more neceſſary far that thou defend thy ſoule with the moſt pure robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and that thou put it on, not by a luke-warme faith. He that cloatheth not himſelfe in this manner, ſhall be tormented with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting cold. Ah! with how many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cloaths have many covered their bodies, whoſe ſoules remaine cold and naked! Conſider, that Gods mercy and goodneſſe are daily renued, and that he doth daily, as it were, beſtow
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10247:150"/> a new life upon us, whilſt he repaires the power of our ſenſes, and reſtores thee the enlivening heat of the Sunne. Let therefore no creature divert thy prayers, let no thoughts ariſe in thee, before thou haſt given God his praiſes. O Omnipotent Lord God, that art the Trinity in Unity, that art alwayes in all things, and hadſt thy being from all eternity, and ſhall be alwayes in all things; O thou my God, take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon me, that I may ſpeake. The houſe of my ſoule is ſtraight, but doe thou enlarge it, that thou mayeſt come into it: it is ruinous, but doe thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it. There are in it thoſe things which may offend both thine eare and eye. I know &amp; acknowledge it, but who ſhall make it cleane? or to whom elſe ſhall I call but to thy ſelfe? Cleanſe me, O Lord, from my hidden offences, and pardon me my open ſinnes. I beleeve, and therefore I ſpeake, thou knoweſt it. My ſinnes doe plead againſt me before thee; pardon me therefore the impiety of my heart, and caſt my ſinnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of the ſea, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found me not in this world, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne me in the world to come. O God that art for ever bleſſed, I doe this
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10247:151"/> day, and at all times; commend unto thee, and into thy powerfull hand, my ſoule, my body, all my thoughts, all my affections, my words, my actions, all my outward and inward things, my ſenſes and underſtanding, my memory, faith and beliefe, that thou mighteſt keepe them day and night, houres and minutes. Heare me, holy Trinity, and preſerve me from all evill, and from all ſcandall, and from all deadly ſin, and from all the ſnares and aſſaults of the devill, and from my viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible enemies.

Teach me, O Lord, to doe thy will, becauſe thou art my God. Give me, O Lord, a heart, that may ſtand in awe of thee, a minde to love thee, an underſtanding to know thee, eares to hearken to thee, eyes to ſee thee. Take pity upon me, O God, take pity upon me, and looke downe upon me from the holy throne of thy Majeſty.

               <p> Of ending the day religiouſly.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS nights and dayes have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes, ſo let the thought and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of Gods mercy have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes in thy heart. For therefore are the viciſſitudes of light and darkneſſe granted us, that there might be an interchangeable reſtoring of labour and reſt, and that each of them might have its fit and appointed time. If God would have made the Sunne to ſtand ſtill, there muſt have beene a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all day. Alſo if the ſtarres had had no motion, who can doubt but their muſt have beene an everlaſting night? but he gave them motion that there might be changes of nights and dayes, and ſuch various motions, that there might be mutuall viciſſitudes of light and darkneſſe, in which, alternate ſpaces of labour and of reſt might appeare unto us. Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoule, that hath appointed the Moone for its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſeaſons, and the Sunne to know her going downe that it may be night, wherein all beaſts of the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:10247:152"/> forreſt ſteale abroad; the young Lions roaring after their prey, doe ſeeke their food, and when the Sunne ariſeth, they retire themſelves, and lay themſelves downe in their dens: but man goeth forth to his worke and his tillage untill the evening. How ample, O God, are thy works! how wiſely haſt thou made them all! how full is the earth of thy poſſeſſions! Conſider well, O man, what thy work and labour hath beene this day. If thy endevours have beene honeſt, aſcribe them to God; if thou haſt learned any good, impute it to God; but if thou haſt done any evill, and haſt offended either God or thy neighbour, humbly crave pardon for it, nor ſleepe the ſleepe of oblivion or ſecurity with thy ſinnes upon thee. That is an accurſed and darkſome night, in which thou goeſt to bed without reconciling thy ſelfe unto God. Caſt up thy reckoning, and wipe out thy ſcores, being to account with thy God: and if thou finde thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count faire (which, alas, ſeldome or never fals out) give praiſes to the Lord; but if it appeare ſoule, caſt thy ſelfe groveling at the feet of thy Lord, and implore his unſpeakable mercy, that if
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10247:153"/> thou wert even this night to be called to his judgement ſeat, thou mighteſt by it be excuſed. If thou have moved any man to anger and indignation, deſire his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor let the Sunne ſet under this troubled cloud: If he forgive thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware afterwards; but if he refuſe thee pardon, faile not earneſtly to begge of God forgiveneſſe of thy offence. And thou, doe that willingly to another, that thou wouldeſt have another doe to thee. Revenge not thine owne quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell; for God hath reſerved vengeance to himſelfe. Surely he muſt needs be accounted very bold, that dares wreſt Gods ſword out of his hand. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were wont to doe this when the day was ended, and they retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their reſt, they asked their ſoule, what wound of it was that day healed? what vice it had reſiſted? in what part it was growne better? Let anger ceaſe, and it will be more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate; let thy ſoule know that ſhe muſt daily come before her Judge. What ſhouldeſt thou that art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian thinke of? is not thy ſoule alſo a ſecret ſearcher and cenſurer of thee? ſhe knowes thy manner, ſhe retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cloſet of her thoughts, and ſees
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10247:153"/> what ſhe hath ſecretly wiſhed for. O heavenly Lord, to whoſe bottomleſſe goodneſſe and infinite kindneſſe we owe all things, that haſt given the moſt cleare light of the day as well to the bad as to the good, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the works of their calling, and haſt lovingly afforded us the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilence of the night to refreſh the ſtrength of our bodies, and to wipe out the cares of the minde, I beſeech thee that thoſe things which I have this day committed, either through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane negligence, or inbred malice, may for thy unſpeakable mercies ſake be forgiven me; and vouchſafe unto me also, that this night (by thy bleſſing) may be happy unto me; and thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my pure keeper and protector, I may be free in it from the nightly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the devill, that my ſleepe make both my body and ſoule more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the next day to ſerve thee. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this life there is not an houre wherein we can aſſure our ſelves from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of that evening when thou ſhalt come, and the dead be raiſed at the ſounding of thy holy Angels trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, I beſeech thee that thou wilt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the eyes of my ſoule, that my
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10247:154"/> faith may not bee extinguiſhed, and I ſleepe in everlaſting death, but that I may reſt in thee, in whom even the dead do live, who liveſt, and raigneſt, for ever more, Amen.</p>

               <p> Of Death, the laſt Judgement, Hell, and Happineſſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN all thy words remember thy laſt things, and thou ſhalt never ſin; no artificiall medicine, nor any doctrine doth ſo overcome pride, ſo conquer malice, ſo quench luſt, or ſo trample upon the vanities of this world, as the remembrance of our laſt things. What are thoſe our laſt things? let others here diſpute what they be, but let the godly weigh the matter diligently with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; thy Death, the laſt Judgement, the glory of Heaven, the paines of Hell; theſe are the things thou muſt meditate of. What comes more ſuddenly and when we leſſe think of it than Death? We die daily, for part of our life is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſhed, and even while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, doth our life grow leſſe; the time that paſſeth away, is loſt; we even
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10247:154"/> divide this very day we now enjoy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene death and our ſelves. Wretched man, why diſpoſeſt thou not of thy ſelfe every houre? Think thou mayeſt now die, becauſe thou knoweſt thou muſt die: call to mind that the time is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon the wings, wherein thy eyes muſt ſinke into thy head, the veines of thy body ſhall be crackt in pieces, and thy heart ſhall be cleft with ſorrow; remember thine owne frailtie, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the miſerable eſtate of thy pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; call to mind in the bitterneſſe of thy ſoule thy yeares paſt, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of mans life. Amidſt the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine things of man, yet is death moſt certaine; yet what is found more uncertaine than the houre of death? it takes no pitie upon want, it reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not riches; and to conclude, it ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth neither wiſdome, manners, nor age; this only is the difference, that death ſtandeth at the old mans doore, and for the young man he lyes in ambuſh; every one therefore ought well to feare this laſt day, becauſe every one in the day of Judgement ſhall be judged for ſuch as he ſhall be found at his day of death. Upon this only moment of our life depends eternity that hath no end!
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10247:155"/> What is more terrible than judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and what can bee imagined more intolerable than hell? What will a man feare, if hee feare not theſe things, if horrour ſeize not on him, and if dread doe not cauſe him to tremble! O man, if thou have loſt the ſhame which belongs to ſo noble a creature, if thou bee not ſenſible of the ſorrows of affliction, which is alſo a property that belongs to mortall creatures, yet loſe not at leaſt thy feare. Feare therefore, O man, becauſe in death thou muſt be parted from all the good things of this thy body, and the ſweet marriage knot of thy united ſoule and body muſt be cut in ſunder by this moſt bitter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce. Feare, becauſe in that terrible Judgement thou muſt ſtand before him into whoſe hands it is a moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing to fall, even before ſuch an Examiner from whom nothing can be hid; if iniquitie be found in thee, thou muſt be baniſhed the ſociety of bliſſe and glory, and bee ſevered from the number of the bleſſed. Feare, becauſe in hell thou muſt be expoſed to inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and everlaſting torments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thy portion with the devill and his angels, even in the everlaſting fire
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10247:155"/> prepared for them. Doſt thou not yet feare the face of the Judge, which is even terrible to the angelicall Powers? Doſt not thou tremble at the wrath of that powerfull One, at his angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and his ſharp words? Art thou not affraid of the teeth of the infernall beaſt, of the belly of hell, of thoſe yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, fore-runners of our devourings? Are we not yet affraid of the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worme, ſcorching flames, ſmoak and vapour, brimſtone and ſtormie tempeſts? O! who ſhall give water to my head, and a fountaine of teares un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mine eyes, that by my weeping I may prevent that weeping and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth, and thoſe hard bands of hands and feet, and that weight of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, fettering, burning and yet not conſuming chaines; and that I may come to thee, my Lord, and my God? Yet if any be ſo curſedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, ſo fierce and ſteely, that hee cannot be troubled with the feare of ill; yet who can be ſo madde and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that he will not be touched with the deſire of good things? There are laid up endleſſe good things for them that make a godly end; even things which the eye hath not ſeene, nor the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10247:156"/> eare heard, nor ever entred into the heart of man to conceive, which God hath prepared for thoſe that love him; thoſe things the preparer and worker whereof is God. What things muſt they be, thinkeſt thou? The eye hath not ſeene them, becauſe they are not colour; the eare hath not heard them, for they are not a ſound; nor hath it entred into mans heart to conceive them, becauſe the heart of man muſt aſcend unto them. Why labour I then to make my tongue to utter that, which my heart cannot conceive; which is to be beleeved, and not to be beheld? nay, it is not onely inviſible, but alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when that moſt perilous moment approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, wherein I ſhall enter into the way of immortality, then give mee a quiet and pleaſing repoſe, that in the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and confeſſion of thy grace, I may yeeld up my ſpirit, and my poore ſoule with peace and gladneſſe, and may deliver it into thy hands; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let mee bee long tormented, as I have a thouſand times deſerved; and that I may enjoy peace on the earth in my body, and may watch, and be made coheire of the reſurrection to life of all
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:10247:156"/> the beleevers, that I may praiſe and glorifie thee with gladneſſe, and may give thee thanks for evermore, for all the innumerable bleſſings which thou haſt beſtowed upon mee, through the whole ſpace of my pilgrimage. Call me not to an account for my old ſcores, and remember not the ſins of my youth, but be mercifull unto me, according to thy great mercies, and ſuſtaine me in a firme faith and comfort, even to my laſt gaſpe, that neither ſinne, death, or the divell doe me any hurt, nor that my own fleſh make me impatient, but that I may enter in unto thee, that I may dwell with thee, and may remaine with thee for evermore, Amen.</p>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IS it this, that divideth the entrailes, parteth the bowels, woundeth the heart, tyes the tongue, ſhutteth the lips, diſtracteth the ſenſes, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmes all our members with feare? Rivers ſlow from our eyes, our cheekes are watered with teares, and all this torrent hath its originall from this one word, a terrible word, by the force
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:10247:157"/> and threates whereof feare and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh are bred in us; a word that no day, no voice ſhall determine, no ſtarre-light ſhall ſhadow, no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation ſhall darken; a word that melts the marrow, and ſoftens, breakes, and even minces the heart and bones, though harder than the Adamant or Marble. This word is Eternity, a word of longer continuance than the Heavens, more terrible than thunder and lightning, or any tempeſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. It is Eternity, that hath neither pauſe, meaſure, nor end, and drives on the minds of men (as it were) with goades, and ſpurs, and pricks; ſo that they ſearch not after mutable or tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things. This word hath moved many to pluck of their glittering crownes from their ayery heads, and to deſpiſe the lofty bayes, and made them let fall their towring plumes; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on a courſer habit, to contemplate higher and more divine things. This word doth wholely poſſeſſe me, nor ſuffers me to enjoy any encreaſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; it infuſes into my moſt diſquieted ſoule care, feare, and griefe. O end, moſt remote from any end! ô time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out time! O yeare and no yeare! O
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:10247:157"/> number not to bee ſummed up of any! Deſcend, deſcend my ſoule to hell, not to mix thy ſelfe with flames, but to avoid thoſe conſuming fires. The wicked might beare it, if it could be ſo gently dealt with him, that Aetna might be his place of torment, that the Vultures might continually gnaw his liver, that the Spiders might weave Cobwebs in this throat that he might bee nouriſhed with aconit, that he might be tormented with boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pitch, that he might drink nought but dragons blood, that hee might bee fed with glowing coales, that his body might bee cloathed with a perpetuall ſcurfe, that he might be broiled on a gridiron, that he might be peirced with ſpeares, bee bound to a ſtake to bee burnt, that hee might bee pluckt in pieces by wild horſes, that hee might be choaked with brimſtone, that hee might bee ſtretched on the wrack, that he might be continually pining to death for want of meat and drink; that hee might bee butchered with pugniards: that wicked wretch might ſuffer this end for a thouſand yeares continuance, yea for thouſand of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands added to that thouſand, if there
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:10247:158"/> might be hope at length of an end of tormenting. How great ſoever a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or torture be, or how great a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xation, yet a hoped for end doth make them eaſier to be borne of us; it is the eternity of them that doth truly wrack and torture us. It is that that makes the paines of hell, it is that that makes plagues to be plagues indeed, that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all puniſhments into one, and does not only double, but infinitely multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the flames thereof. Alas! alas! what is Eternity? What Geometry can meaſure it? It is not dayes or months, or yeares, that can ſet a period to it, not hundreds of thouſand revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of times, not millions of millions of Olympiades. Yet the paſſage to this never ending eternity, is wrought by the flying unſtableneſſe of a few dayes. The ſun riſeth and ſetteth; but they that come to this, do never returne; here the beginning is the end, and the end the beginning. O life worſe than any death! O perpetuall dying, without a death! thou ſhall be hurried thither, who ever thou art, that doeſt here glut thy ſoule with pleaſures, that doeſt follow after the corruptions of thy fleſh, that giveſt unto a harlot thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10247:158"/> which Chriſt hath redeemed with his blood, that ſtretcheſt thy throat with quaffing, and ſtuffeſt thy paunch with gluttonous eating. For what ſhall that fire devoure, but thy ſins? The more thou ſinneſt, the more fuell thou ſtoreſt to be conſumed of that fire: there are many deſcents thither, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an aſcent from thence; he that once falls thither, muſt alwayes abide there, and is loſt without any hope of ſuccour. He that is once numbred amongſt the inhabitants of heaven, ſhall alwayes rejoyce; and he that is once joyned in company with the furies of hell, ſhall alwayes be affrighted. The joys of the bleſſed ſoules ſhall be without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or meaſure; the torments of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed ſoules ſhall bee without metes and bounds, without meane or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. After yeares infinite and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number are paſſed, they are ſtill compelled to thinke that theſe are but only the beginnings of puniſhments: One houre of puniſhment there ſhall be more grievous to us than a hundred yeares ſpent here in repentance; the coales ſhall not there be dead, but glowing; no abatement, but increaſe of heate. The puniſhments ſhall increaſe,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10247:159"/> the puniſhers ſhall be exaſperated, the place of torment ſhall be enlarged, and the number of the tormentors increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Let the citizens of Heaven rejoyce, and let thoſe above for ever live; let the damned for ever mourn, &amp; thoſe in hell for ever be dying. Tread the path to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while it is open, run in that way while it lyes faire before thee: the path ſhall be ſhut up, and the way deſtroyed, if thou once go out of it: dogs ſhall teare the Goates, but God ſhall refreſh the Lambes; the Hawke ſhall prey upon the Crowes; but God ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Doves. Whilſt the gueſt of Heaven is filled with delight and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, what can bee ſet before thoſe that lament in filth and corruption? let thoſe that are there famiſhed, beg for crums, &amp; for fragments, to ſtop their querulous throats, they ſhall not receive their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable complaints; They ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for ever to drinke their owne teares, and to coole their throats with the continuall waters flowing from their eyes; their drinke ſhall be a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of griefe, that ſhall never grow dry, a fire in which they are conſumed; a pitcher of gall ſhall bee mixed with their teares, which ſhall neither bee
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10247:159"/> drawn dry, or broken inſunder; the gall ſhall flow continually, and the gueſt ſhall continually bee urged to drinke. Ah! how much better would it be to thirſt for ever, than continually to be deſtroyed with this drinke, and perpetually to groane and tremble. If thou once enter in, thou ſhalt never get out; if the enemy of the bleſſed doe once get poſſeſſion of thee, hee will be for ever thine hoſt; firſt thou ſhalt be preſented with dainties; afterward, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as long as thou wilt, thou ſhalt ne-never ſee any; this table, ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes furniſhed, and never empty of ill meates; to morrow, to morrow thou ſhall ſuppoſe it may be better, but every moment ſhall be as to day. To day as thou readeſt, or heareſt theſe things, ruminate diligently thereon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent fervently, nor expect or thinke thou will call to morrow for mercy. O eternity! he is loſt for ever that is not alwayes mindfull of eternity! O man, O ſoule of man, who hath both reaſon and meditation granted her, if the love of God cannot lay hold of thee, yet let at leaſt the feare of the judge, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the grave, the ſnares of death, the paines hell, the burning fire, the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:10247:160"/> gnawing worme, the ſtinking brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the ſcortching flames, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evils, and the eternity of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and keepe thee in awe; for the ſpace of eternity is ſo great, that if any damned wretch ſhould drop but one teare every thouſand yeares from his eyes, yet would thoſe teares come to be more water before that ſpace ſhould have an end than the whole world could contein.
